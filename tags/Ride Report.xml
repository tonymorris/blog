    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ride-20150524-thulimbah">Ride 20150524 Thulimbah</h1>
<p>We planned to meet at Rathdowney around 0845 on the Sunday morning, knowing that Rob &amp; Athol had never seen the granite belt. We would take Mt Lindesay Highway (or is it Road? haha, there is a back-story to that) to Woodenbong then Legume, before stopping at the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.4351&amp;mlon=152.3838#map=15/-28.4351/152.3838">Maryland River Bridge</a> for some beach riding. Soon, we’d turn on to the scenic <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.5496&amp;mlon=152.1307#map=15/-28.5496/152.1307">Wylie Creek Road</a> through <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.5627&amp;mlon=151.9986#map=14/-28.5627/151.9986">Maryland</a> and on to Thulimbah.</p>

<hr />
<p>Not another body in sight, only moo-cows, we started the slow climb from 500 to 950 metres above sea level. Arriving at Thulimbah, we did a loop of the Hinze Enduro Loop, then said our goodbyes.</p>
<p>Entering <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-28.5642/151.8168">Passchendaele State Forest</a> from the east, we did a few little loops before deciding that food and fuel were in order. Having already seen an abundance of wildlife, I was mindful of the risks at highway speed. That was when a tidings of magpies took off from the shoulder of the road. Having no air traffic control in this area, these magpies were completely unaware of my ground speed, which tripled their take-off speed. One of the individuals, mistakenly, chose the strategy of “outpace the threat.” There was no way to save it, and before I could let up the brakes, I could see an explosion of feathers in the mirror. I ventured back to make sure there was no more suffering and despite the unfortunate circumstance, felt a mild relief that it was all over for that miscalculating magpie.</p>
<p>We fueled and ate at Stanthorpe, while planning the next leg. Another journey into Passchendaele was all too tempting. Aiming for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.60556&amp;mlon=151.78448#map=17/-28.60556/151.78448">Swiper’s Gully</a>, and not knowing if the rabbit fence would prevent access, I came upon some familiar track landmarks where I reassured myself that this was the way in.</p>
<p>That was when we decided to stop for a short meeting and Rob’s DRZ became a DRZZZZZZ. Refusing to rest on the kickstand, the DRZ chose to have a little snooze on its left side. Once again <a href="http://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/mount-mee-ride-report/index.html">[last time]</a>, we broke out the orange toolkit for adjustments and repairs. Soon, we were on the trail to Swiper’s Gully at the south end of Passchendaele. Hooting through the rocky, thin trails, a wild pig scooted out of our way, and then we came upon an emu carcass. Black cockatoos called out as an eagle left its high perch in a tree. That was when I knew, dusk was coming.</p>

<hr />
<p>Turning the bikes east along Donnellys Castle Road, the abundance of bouncing wallabies, while serene, also served as a caution of what was ahead. Thulimbah, then Wylie Creek Road, I must have seen 40 wallabies by now. We stopped for a road-side meeting where we discussed the dangers ahead. As the sun went down, I saw a small kangaroo leap in front of Rob’s bike. Close call, I thought, but then a larger roo followed behind, looking to take on the idling DRZ at 70kph. It was one of those moments where there is no time to reach for the brake; just a shot of adrenaline as the big lumbering beast appears in the headlight beam and before there is any reaction, it is all over. It must have missed Rob’s DR-Z by less than a metre, from where I was, about 40 metres behind.</p>

<hr />
<p>We stopped again at the end of Wylie Creek Road for a meeting. By now, the sun was truly gone and Venus and Jupiter were shining bright in the northern sky. Athol asked, “where is Rathdowney from here?” Why, it’s just over the hill yonder, a tad beyond Legume, a smaller tad passed Woodenbong and then a tiny tad and we are there!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24nHE-tflII" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<hr />
<p>We had another couple of hours ahead of us and Athol was regretting having a dependence on the factory headlight. Never again, I swore, after doing the same journey with a Husqvarna factory headlight years ago. Corners are like the lottery; maybe there is an obstacle in two seconds time, but you won’t know it until it’s too late. The cold was setting in and I turned on the heated grips.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jbScRQW.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jbScRQW.jpg" alt="" style="width: 640px;"/></a></p>
<hr />
<p>We held a steady pace for the next hour or so, to Woodenbong for the next meeting. By now, shivering was the only remaining strategy against the wind chill. Not long to go now. Rathdowney wasn’t too far away, and only another 110km after that and I’d be home.</p>
<p>Winding through the twisty roads of Mount Lindesay Highway, using the advisory speed signs to estimate corner entrance speed, we came upon a plonker. This was the type of plonker who would enter a corner far too slow, speed up mid-corner, overshoot, then use the brakes to adjust. Yeah those plonkers, and not a straight-away for a long time.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes of cornering like a see-saw with bipolar disorder, finally, the solid white line gave way and it was throttles wound on. Rob and Athol didn’t make it, but I got up to the posted speed limit and set in for the final leg to Rathdowney. Arriving there in short order, I parked up the KTM next to the parked car and waited. I could hear the two DRZs puttering along, approaching.</p>
<p>That was when … the unbelievable happened. My eyes were deceiving me. It just wasn’t happening. Was this real? Did I just see that? Did I miss a memo? Is there something I have simply misunderstood? These questions raced through my mind as the two DRZs could be heard in the distance, fading away. They’d both ridden to Rathdowney, along the main stretch of road, then <strong>kept going</strong>.</p>
<p>I could not figure out how this plan change could have worked out. By what method had these two come to the conclusion that passing through Rathdowney was going to work? It was now 2100 in the evening. That would mean the car must stay here, in Rathdowney. Just what was the plan?</p>
<p>Then it hit me. There was no plan. My friends, as adorable as they are, have completely missed the fact that they’d passed through Rathdowney. In their mind, Rathdowney was perpetually in front of them. It was time to act quick. Soon, they’d be out of phone range. I got through to Athol first, insisting that he’d ridden straight through Rathdowney. Then the phone cut out.</p>
<p>I rang Rob, “You’ve ridden through Rathdowney. Turn around and come back!” He didn’t believe me. OK, fine, two DRZs just went through Rathdowney; one with exactly the same spotlight configuration as Rob’s bike and another with a factory headlight, but it was someone else.</p>
<p>I later learned that Rob and Athol had a roadside meeting, where there was scepticism that they’d passed through Rathdowney, but decided to turn around anyway, just to confirm my mistake.</p>
<p>I set up a strobe light for their impending return, so as not to lose them again and sure enough, 10 minutes later, the approaching single cylinders could be heard in the distance. I was in awe. I am still in awe.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ride-20150509-mount-mee">Ride 20150509 Mount Mee</h1>
<p>We left Everton Hills, bound for Dayboro, the unmissable town before Mount Mee. Rob D. had a small dingle on a narrow, downhill bend, leading into a single-lane bridge. He had a couple of scratches and so did the KLR, but soon we were back on the road.</p>
<p>At Dayboro, we grabbed a drink before heading up the hill. Soon we were on the gravel fire trails of Mount Mee State Forest and the tiny 17&quot; supermoto front wheel (with a Pirelli Corsa Rosso tyre) of the 690 constantly demanded fast reflexes.</p>
<p>Headed up to Wivenhoe Lookout, the fun way, with the jumps, then on to Rocky Hole. When we arrived at Woodford, Rob D. had had enough of the loose surface and took the tar road. Rob H. and I turned back the way we came and nailed it through the forest.</p>
<p>Soon, we were back on the tar, heading home. That was when I was hit in the <strong>helmet visor</strong> by a loose bolt from the leading DR-Z at 100kph. After my initial shock of this profound collision, I looked up to see the rear guard of the DR-Z thrashing around loosely. Nothing some cable-ties couldn’t fix.</p>
<p>When we arrived at base, we parked up the KTM, DR-Z and KLR. As thoughts of having a post-ride beer came upon us, instead, we were obliged to repair the lesser two of the three. The DR-Z needed a less temporary repair for its missing bolt and the KLR had lost its seat mount bolts and one <strong>rear subframe bolt</strong>. The KTM watched on.</p>
<p>Now to be completely fair, all was not free for the KTM. It too required repairs. Given its nature, it had devoured a rear tyre (again, Pirelli Corsa Rosso).</p>
<p>Once the KLR and DR-Z were put back together, with assistance from the All Hours Everton Hills Bolt &amp; Tool Shop, they were on the way.</p>
<p>The KTM will be fed its usual diet of rubber through the week.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<script src="http://www.openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<p>I have never written a ride report before so please forgive any oversights. However, this ride was notable, so I thought best to write it up.</p>
<p>I left Buderim at around 1030 on the morning of 23 December, with the intention of heading west toward Conondale. I only had a rough idea of my planned route.</p>
<h4 id="nobles-road">Nobles Road</h4>
<p>My first change of plan was the belief that I could take <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.734755&amp;mlon=152.980079%20&amp;zoom=16#map=16/-26.734755/152.980079">Nobles Road</a> so as to bypass Eudlo. Being a gazetted road, I thought it should be no problem. Alas, it was was one of many “private access” roads with a barrier part way along the trail. I could have gone around it, but I was too early in the ride to consider any dramas. So backtrack I did, back up on to Ilkley Road and through Eudlo.</p>
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.734755&mlon=152.980079%20&zoom=19#map=19/-26.734755/152.980079">

<p></a></p>
<script type="text/javascript">
map = new OpenLayers.Map("map.noblesroad");
map.addLayer(new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM());

var lonLat = new OpenLayers.LonLat(152.980079, -26.734755).transform(
  new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:4326")

<h4 id="brandenburg-road">Brandenburg Road</h4>
<p>After heading south to Mooloolah, I turned west toward Maleny. This is when I found the super fun <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.765144&amp;mlon=152.957474%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.765144/152.957474">Brandenburg Road</a>. A hard-packed, cement road with a loose gravel surface, this was going to be bliss on the TE510. Hootin’ along, I came to a steep, narrow hill with a couple of cars and a rigid (no articulations) truck in front.</p>
<p>The truck struggled up the hill at walking pace and, for safety reasons, I chose to stop and wait for it to complete the ascent. I caught up again and in front of us, another fun hill (going to waste!) but with a wider road permitting a pass. This was when the truck’s buddy behind him in a ute decided to overtake. So I wait for the overtake and my first feeling of disbelief sets in. The ute driver slows to the truck’s pace so as to have a discussion with the driver. FFS are you serious mate?! On a narrow ascending hill at about 8kph, this assclown thought it best to block all possible traffic to talk about his plans that night <em>to the driver above and beside him</em>. I was a bit gobsmacked at the stupidity unfolding in front of my eyes. That initial feeling is moving. Using voice signals over the top of the struggling diesel engine, I let these idiots know that I was unhappy with the dangerous situation they’d just created. Get a UHF ya twits. However, I am sure it was all lost in translation and stupidity. Like internet mailing lists I guess. Moving on.</p>
<p>Soon after, I was able to overtake and left the circus show behind to enjoy the remainder of Brandenburg Road and onto Maleny-Kenilworth Road.</p>
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.765144&mlon=152.957474%20&zoom=17#map=17/-26.765144/152.957474">

<h4 id="cox-road">Cox Road</h4>
<p>My next plan was to try cutting across Maleny-Kenilworth Road via <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.727266&amp;mlon=152.81675%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.727266/152.81675">Cox Road</a>. After turning into a narrow, gravel Cox Road, I came across car bodies littered all along – mostly old Toyota Landcruisers. A kilometre or so along, there were construction vehicles and I was unsure where the main track was. I headed along one of many narrow tracks and soon found myself in a cow paddock. Looking around, I found an even narrower, foliage-covered steep uphill track. “Looks fun, but I am probably going to turn around”, I thought. Up the hill I went and it became very steep and rocky with a drop to the side. I considered the consequences of going over out here on my own and decided to head on out.</p>
<p>As I left Cox Road, I came upon a closed gate. “That wasn’t there before!” Well it was, but it had been left open and I didn’t notice it. Someone clearly didn’t want general vehicle access along this road – another “private access” road.</p>
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.727266&mlon=152.81675%20&zoom=17#map=17/-26.727266/152.81675">

<h4 id="maleny-kenilworth-road">Maleny-Kenilworth Road</h4>
<p>The scenery along the 15 or so kilometres of Maleny-Kenilworth Road was amazing. The temperature had dropped a little from the dry, hot summer sun to a cool breeze. I’d clearly put on some altitude. I didn’t check my altimeter but I guessed around 600m asl. It had run out of batteries around there anyway – as you can tell by the track log. I came into <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.729532&amp;mlon=152.717631%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.729532/152.717631">Conondale</a> and thought it best to fuel up.</p>
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.729532&mlon=152.717631%20&zoom=17#map=17/-26.729532/152.717631">

<h4 id="conondale">Conondale</h4>
<p>I filled up on 91 RON fuel again, knowing that the Husky won’t be happy about that – there was no 95 RON available. This causes some pinging when the engine is under load, but I’m sure she will forgive me.</p>
<p>Filling up on sugars myself, a local struck up a conversation. I told him my plan to head down <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.703964&amp;mlon=152.684487%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.703964/152.684487">Grigor Road</a> and see what happens after that. He told me about a huge log that he’d hit a couple of years earlier, knocking himself out of consciousness and into hospital. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was about to pay a visit to that log myself. He also mentioned that “turning right” off the track will take me to (what I now know is) Booloumba – I had trouble interpreting the pronunciation at the time.</p>
<h4 id="grigor-road">Grigor Road</h4>
<p>Grigor Road was a welcome sight. I’d ridden down this road two days earlier in the opposing direction. Back on the gravel again and eventually, red, fertile clay. Dodging cows, I ploughed through the mud pit that I’d earlier roosted Jason with. Over the crest of a hill at medium pace and immediately in front of me, a 2 metre wide log across the track – a much bigger surprise in the opposite direction. It was easily avoided, but I could imagine having some trouble if I was off line and at full pace. Yep, that’d hurt.</p>
<p>Grigor Road soon turned narrow and full of ruts. Much fun to be had! I passed a right turn but it was signed “No vehicle access.” Oh well, maybe this wasn’t the one that the local was referring to anyway.</p>
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.703964&mlon=152.684487%20&zoom=17#map=17/-26.703964/152.684487">

<h4 id="mubbip-woo">Mubbip woo!</h4>
<p>I took <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.736464/152.619499&amp;mlon=152.619499%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.736464/152.619499">a right turn off Grigor Road</a> and entered a steady ascent. I was obviously putting on even more altitude as I entered lush rainforest. I could hear Eastern Whipbirds over the sound of the Husqvarna’s engine. Insects and birds flittered about through the narrow track and I was having fun on the loose twisty corners. Soon I decided to pull up to properly take in the scenery. I was feeling a bit parched anyway.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.70909&amp;mlon=152.56792%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.70909/152.56792">a nice straight</a> to avoid any disasters with other potential traffic and pulled the bike to a stop.</p>

<hr />
<p>I’d rehydrated and eaten a couple of supplies I’d bought at Conondale.</p>
<p>It must have been 4 or 5 minutes when I heard it. I couldn’t believe my ears. There was not another human within 10km of my position, so I thought.</p>
<p><em>“Mubbip woo!”</em> came from the trees to the side. Did I just hear that, seriously? Had I inadvertently ingested some funny flowers as I hurtled through these tracks, narrowly avoiding the overhanging foliage as it competed for space? Then it came again, loud and clear, “mubbip woo!”</p>
<p>I knew this noise. It was Jason &amp; Jason, the yowie searchers I’d met in D’Aguilar National Park a few months ago. Again, at that time, I thought I was alone in the twilight forest. However, I stopped to say hello where they enthusiastically told me about their yowie adventures. They had advised me to install a rear-facing camera on the Husqvarna to film yowies because “they are always behind you” after which, they had given me their business card.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/qwTJ8y9.jpg"><img height="816" width="612" src="http://i.imgur.com/qwTJ8y9.jpgg" alt="J&J Yowie Search"></a></p>
<p>When I got home after this ride, in August 2013, I decided to take a look at the youtube channel. This is where I learned how to correctly call for yowies. A short, sharp call of “mubbip woo!” will attract and help identify the presence of yowies in the national parks of south-east Queensland. Here is a demonstration, starting at 3:17.</p>

<p>Yep, sure enough, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.70909&amp;mlon=152.56792%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.70909/152.56792">in the middle of absolutely nowhere</a>, I’d found them again. They must have been just 100 metres away, somewhere in the trees, calling for yowies.</p>
<p>I spun out. This truly was happening. I was completely stunned by the coincidence and immediately started hunting for alternative explanations. Yep, I am as lucid as can possibly be – this is real. I was in the middle of the forest. I was completely lost.</p>
<p>Awestruck, I was able to gather myself enough to begin recording on my phone. The “mubbip woo” calls are very distinct but since they are distant, you will probably need earphones. Also, sorry about my squeaky boots.</p>

<hr />
<p>I suspect the yowie searchers didn’t realise I was there in Conondale NP. They’d heard the bike coming, then heard it stop, believing me to have passed. The “mubbip woo” calls had started a few minutes after I’d stopped. As you can see, I made an attempt to say hi for a second meeting by approaching their location, but it was not to be. Not to be disturbing the yowies (and yowie searchers) in their habitat, I decided to move on. It’s an enormous forest and we can all share. The only other species willing to socialise with me here were the horse-flies. Bye yowie searchers, it was fun again. Mubbip wooooooooooo!</p>
<h4 id="exploring">Exploring</h4>
<p>I followed the track north until eventually I exited the forest. I had passed an extraordinary number of track turn-offs – several to Jimna, one or two to Kenilworth and Kilcoy. I was now on Gigher Creek Road, heading north. There were tracks everywhere. I reached <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.673211&amp;mlon=152.514170%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.673211/152.514170">Yeilo Homestead</a>, which I only knew about because it had a road named after it.</p>

<p>From here, I turned around and immediately saw that there was an alternative track back into the forest. A steady ascent, I assumed it would come to an end – a service road of some sort. Nope, I was on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.674703&amp;mlon=152.514804%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.674703/152.514804">Langston Road</a> heading south.</p>
<p>Exploring now, I traversed Buffalo Road, Middle Road and I passed the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.707681&amp;mlon=152.534779%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.707681/152.534779">Sunday Creek Environmental Education Centre</a>.</p>
<p>I turned right down Cockalorum Road. This road is probably up there as the most fun in the forest. A very narrow, winding track full of surprises, such as a rutted-out, mud-filled trench after lifting both wheels off a small crest. A lush rainforest road, I wondered if vehicular traffic really were permitted, but I hadn’t seen any signage to indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Cockalorum Road popped out again on Middle Road and by now it was getting late. I was heading back in the general direction of the yowies, hoping to say hi just one more time, the trippers. However, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.694135&amp;mlon=152.561194%20&amp;zoom=17#map=17/-26.694135/152.561194">Sunday Creek Road</a> had me hooked. A wide, sweeping road I expected to come upon 4x4 traffic, but alas, I saw only one car who kindly allowed me to pass.</p>
<h4 id="leaving">Leaving</h4>
<p>Making my way to Kenilworth, I passed <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.680448&amp;mlon=152.606385%20&amp;zoom=19#map=19/-26.680448/152.606385">Peters Creek Lookout</a> on the left. I didn’t have time to stop. I needed to get back to Buderim before dark – the headlight on this bike isn’t the brightest and with dusk wildlife soon to make an appearance, I kept the pace up.</p>
<p>I passed the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.676427&amp;mlon=152.620923%20&amp;zoom=19#map=19/-26.676427/152.620923">Booloumba Falls</a> turn off (it was signed), then <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.655751&amp;mlon=152.645472%20&amp;zoom=19#map=19/-26.655751/152.645472">Booloumba Lookout</a> and continued on to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.646357&amp;mlon=152.646916%20&amp;zoom=19#map=19/-26.646357/152.646916">Booloumba campgrounds</a>.</p>

<p>Just after Booloumba campgrounds, I came around a corner to find a <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-26.634651&amp;mlon=152.650420%20&amp;zoom=19#map=19/-26.634651/152.650420">creek crossing</a> in front of me. Booloumba Creek must have been 40 metres wide but it was not flowing very fast. Given the width, I became a bit concerned with the possible depth. Had there been rain out here that I didn’t know about? If so, why wasn’t it flowing so fast? Then a Toyota Prado came from the left traversing the creek itself (not the road, the <em>creek</em>). It was only about 30cm deep. A little boy hung out the back window, clearly more excited by my presence than his own in the middle of a creek.</p>
<p>I double-checked that I didn’t leave any vulnerable (non-waterproof) equipment on the bike and I punched first then second. I love putting on a show for children and I could see my bow wave in my peripheral and water well above my head :) The creek became a bit deeper on the other side, but I had a lot of momentum. This only increased the water displacement as I held the throttle on. When I got to the other side, I threw the front wheel skyward, hoping that that little boy will spend his youth aspiring to ride the adventure, like I used to do.</p>
