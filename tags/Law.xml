    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 31 December 2007 the Telecommunications Minister for the Australian government announced that Australia would be introducing mandatory internet filtering. The only implementation of this idea, until now, has been the ridiculed <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-27/asic-accidentally-blocked-250,000-websites-ip-address/5701734">blocking of 250,000 websites by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in April 2013</a> under <em>section 313 of Australia’s Telecommunications Act</em>. The block was intended for only two websites engaged in fraudulent activity. In a subsequent inquiry, ASIC commented that “99.6 per cent of those sites contained no substantive content.” <em>facepalm</em></p>
<p>The reason this occurred is because the block performed filtering of an internet address called an <em>IP address</em>, however, multiple unrelated websites can share an IP address. In implementing this type of filtering, ASIC blocked an unrelated 249,998 websites. Clearly, a blocking mechanism cannot be implemented this way and a repeat has not occurred since. Nevertheless, such profound eyeroll-inducing incompetence has become a recent trend of the (federal) Australian government.</p>
<p>A repeat of some such stupidity is imminent. Not the brightest bricks in the box.</p>
<p>Australian politicians have been banging on about internet filtering for quite some time now. Unfortunately, those same politicians seek their “expert advice” from such (dopey) organisations as the Australian Federal Police. Australia does indeed fund a significant technology research organisation of actual PhD-holding experts in this field, however, the advice that might be provided by such experts (unanimously) would not be conducive to the agenda, and so it is completely ignored.</p>
<p>In June 2015, a bill called <a href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2015B00052">s.115a of the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015</a> was passed in Senate. This bill gives holders of copyright (e.g. television, movies, music) an ability to apply to our Federal Court to have piracy-related websites blocked from being used in Australia. At the forefront of of the agenda of this bill is an effort to block <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/">The Pirate Bay</a> website. Even though this website does not host material that infringes copyright, it contains links to some material, which is copyrighted. Despite the fact that Facebook directly hosts infringing copyrighted material, it is websites like The Pirate Bay that have become the centre of attention.</p>
<p>Since we know that IP-address filtering does not work, and the all parties involved in the implementation of this fascination with website blocking are incompetent, we can easily predict their next move. It is predicted that a technique called <strong>DNS poisoning</strong> will be implemented and of course, this will also not work, because nothing will. Today, it was announced that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-18/village-roadshow-launches-legal-action-to-block-piracy-website/7176688">the first application for implementing this blocking (under the aforementioned bill) has been made to our Federal Court by Village Roadshow</a>. As you can see in the ABC article, it is speculated that DNS poisoning will be the method of implementation for this block.</p>
<p>In this article, I will show you how to circumvent this block. There are a few different ways of achieving this. It is not illegal for me to tell you how to do this, and it is not illegal for you to implement this block. I achieve no monetary gain by writing this article. My single motivation is freedom for myself, and for others. We can all do good things, despite the numpties numptying about in federal government. Aside, if such a block were implemented 10 years ago, it would not have affected me, as my home network already incidentally avoids DNS poisoning. I will show you how to do it too.</p>
<p>First let’s understand a little bit about “DNS.” Suppose you have a broadband connection, such as ADSL or Cable. You might have this service with a provider such as Telstra or Optus. In your home somewhere, you will have a “ADSL modem” or a “cable modem.” Sometimes it is called a modem/router. When you go to a website with a name such as <code>google.com</code> or <code>facebook.com</code>, your computer asks your modem/router to <em>provide an internet address for that name</em>. Your modem/router will have a setting for what to do when this happens. That setting will probably then ask for the internet address for the website name from your service provider (such as Telstra or Optus). When your service provider responds to your modem/router with the address for your desired website, that address is then sent to your computer, so now your computer knows which website address to go to. This happens every time you type a website name into your web browser. DNS is all about a <strong>Naming System</strong> for all this to occur. That’s all you need to know to now understand DNS poisoning.</p>
<p>The method of DNS poisoning is simply this. When your service provider (Telstra, Optus, whatever) sends back the website address for your website name, there is a tiny dunce from our government standing on their legislative pedestal proclaiming the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right that’s it Telstra! Stop telling your customer’s modem/router the correct address for that website name! And you too Optus, and all of you STOP IT RIGHT NOW or else.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, under our new legislation, your service provider, and all Australian service providers, must comply with this demand. Instead of normal operation, your modem/router will be told the incorrect answer for a website name that you type into your web browser, such as <code>thepiratebay.se</code> and now you are blocked from using that website.</p>
<p>However, not all service providers must comply with this request. Specifically, not those located outside of Australia. Other DNS answers for website names will still be providing the correct address. For example, Google has a DNS service that provides the correct answer. Many others exist too.</p>
<p>You are blocked because your modem/router has a setting that says, “when looking up the address for a website name, use my Australian service provider to figure it out.” You can circumvent this by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download and install the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en">Tor Browser</a></p></li>
<li><p>Changing the setting on your modem/router to use a different (non-Australian) DNS service than the automatic one provided by your service provider.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Add a setting on your computer</em> so that a specific website name answers with a specific address. This will only work on that one computer and for that website name. However, you can set many different website names on different computers. It just becomes a bit more tedious.</p></li>
<li><p>There are other mechanisms for circumvention, but they are a bit more complicated, so I will leave those out.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="download-and-install-the-tor-browser">Download and install the Tor Browser</h3>
<p>After you have downloaded and installed the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en">Tor Browser</a>, use this as a web browser to your favourite websites. The Tor Browser will send your internet requests (encrypted) through a networked chain of computers around the world, before ultimately ending up at your preferred website. Importantly, whichever computer is at the end of the chain is the one that will do your DNS resolution. This means it is not your computer, modem/router or internet service provider that is doing your internet requests, but rather, another computer on your behalf. This computer is likely to not be in Australia, and so has circumvented Australia’s internet filtering. This computer that is acting on your behalf is called the <em>exit node</em>, with some other computers in between as <em>intermediate nodes</em>. If the exit node is in say, Germany and there is no DNS poisoning in Germany, then it will receive correct website address answers for website names.</p>
<p>All of this is handled automatically for you by the Tor Browser. You just need to install it and start using it. Unfortunately, if your exit node is still in Australia, then you will still have the DNS poisoning problem. The location of the exit node changes over time, so it is only a temporary problem.</p>
<p>The Tor project is committed to the preservation of your freedom. Be a part of it.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-setting-on-your-modemrouter">Changing the setting on your modem/router</h3>
<p>You will need to go to the administration interface for your router. I understand this might not be easy for some. However, it is often as simple as typing <code>192.168.0.1</code> or <code>192.168.1.1</code> into your web browser. If you are unsure how to do this step, perhaps ask a friend for some help. It is actually quite easy, so give it a try, but if you get stuck, seek out help!</p>
<p>Once you are there, you need to change a setting to “use the given DNS servers”, then enter in the address of a server that does not fall under Australia’s legislation, such as Google. Sometimes the setting will have a “primary” and a “secondary” DNS server setting. The address for Google’s servers are <code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code>. Here is how it looks on a Netgear modem/router that I had lying around:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/osv3MhS.png" alt="Netgear DNS settings" />
<p class="caption">Netgear DNS settings</p>
</div>
<p>Save the settings and once your modem/router is no longer using a DNS service from within Australia, that’s it, you have circumvented Australia’s internet filter. You are no longer DNS-poisoned and all the computers at your house will now receive the correct answer for a website name.</p>
<p><a href="http://mic.com/articles/85987/turkish-protesters-are-spray-painting-8-8-8-8-and-8-8-4-4-on-walls-here-s-what-it-means#.pPjaa8I1v">Here is an example of a similarly oppressed society in Turkey</a>. Regular people spray painted buildings with the Google settings for a DNS service to circumvent their government’s foolish internet filtering service.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/N9BoYDy.jpg" alt="8.8.8.8 in Turkey" />
<p class="caption">8.8.8.8 in Turkey</p>
</div>
<p>You might not wish to use Google’s DNS service. There are other services outside of Australia; for example, OpenDNS. The addresses for OpenDNS are: <code>208.67.222.222</code> and <code>208.67.220.220</code>. You might consider looking into this some more and finding a DNS service (outside of Australia) that you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Wait is it that easy? Yes, it is. So why aren’t more people making this simple change to their home internet settings? Yes, exactly. Now hurry up. Freedom is ours and you are a part of that.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-setting-on-your-specific-computer-for-a-specific-website">Changing the setting on your specific computer for a specific website</h3>
<p>The website address for the name <code>thepiratebay.se</code> at this moment is <code>141.101.118.194</code>. If you typed <code>thepiratebay.se</code> into your web browser, your computer would ask your modem/router for the website address for the name <code>thepiratebay.se</code> and then your modem/router will ask your internet service provider (e.g. Telstra) for the address and it will respond with <code>141.101.118.194</code> and now your web browser will go to that address. If our government has our way, Telstra will give you an <em>incorrect website address</em> instead and your web browser will not go to that website.</p>
<p>However, you can tell your computer not to use your modem/router to find the website address for <code>thepiratebay.se</code> but instead, to make the address always be <code>141.101.118.194</code>. You do this by <em>editing your hosts file</em>.</p>
<p>Open up your hosts file on your computer with a text editor, such as Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac OSX. Your hosts file is located at:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On Windows: <code>%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code></p></li>
<li><p>On Mac OSX: /private/etc/hosts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With your text editor, select <em>open a file</em> and then type in the file location as above. You may have problems with editing or opening this file because of your computer’s security. If that is the case, please ask a friend (or me) to help you. It’s usually a matter of using the administrator account of the computer to successfully edit the file.</p>
<p>With the file open, add the following line at the end of the file:</p>
<p><code>141.101.118.194    thepiratebay.se</code></p>
<p>Save the file and close the text editor.</p>
<p>That’s it, you are done. Your computer will now have the correct answer for the website name <code>thepiratebay.se</code>. You might consider doing this for other website names that you are concerned might fall under Australia’s incompetent internet filtering regime, such as <code>facebook.com</code>. Just kidding, that will never happen. Ever asked yourself why? I digress.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hopefully this is a reasonable start to your proactive pursuit of freedom. There is a lot more if it is interesting to you. Seek it out. Experts in the field enjoy helping you to protect yourself and in doing so, protect their own freedom too.</p>
<p>I hope to leave a better world to my children than the one into which I was born. Join me.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Lane-Splitting in Australia.</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The subject of lane-splitting on a motorcycle often comes up in discussion. In Australia, the legality of lane-splitting is not absolute. For example, under some circumstances, such as two (or even three) motorcycles sharing a lane, this manouvre may be legal (further specifics apply). Under some other circumstances, lane-splitting is illegal.</p>
<p>Below are verbatim excerpts of Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995; Transport Operations (Road Use Management-Road Rules) Regulation 1999 that are relevant to lane-splitting. The name of this legislation is sometimes abbreviated to <em>TORUM</em>. TORUM applies to the state of Queensland and is derived from the Australian Road Rules (ARR).</p>
<p>Other Australian state and territory road use legislation is also derived from the ARR. Although these sections have been excerpted directly from TORUM, they can also be found in the ARR (under the same sections) and also in the road use legislation for other Australian states and territories.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bradclow.blogspot.com/2009/03/tonys-letter-to-medical-board-of.html">A friend of mine, Brad Clow, has received demands to remove one of his blog posts by a lawyer.</a> This post contains a letter that I wrote to the Medical Health Board of Queensland in March 2009. The letter mentions the name of a doctor, from whom I have also received recent threats of legal action; specifically allegations of defamation. Brad has removed the name of this doctor.</p>
<p>These threats are without any legal basis at all and a cursory read of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/">The Defamation Act 2005</a> makes this really quite apparent. Specifically, sections <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/s25.html">25</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/s31.html">31</a>. Neither myself nor Brad have made any defamatory claims against Dr Michael McEniery, however, I do have <em>honestly held opinions</em> which are based on <em>facts which are substantially true</em>. These opinions and facts will be made available for public viewing after I have sought advice from legal experts. Advice in this regard is most welcome and I promise a remarkable and quite alarming story.</p>
<p>It took me a little over a year longer to finally determine the correct diagnosis. I had an entrapment neuropathy of the superficial peroneal nerve 10cm proximal to the lateral malleolus causing traction injury and subsequent foraminal stenosis at the right L5 nerve root, resulting in severe neurological deficit. I also had anteromedial osseous impingement syndrome (caused by tibia/talus collision from foot drop) and four improperly installed screws causing (painful) interference in the talar joint. It is now 6 months since surgical resolution and I am left with some neurological deficit. It is not known if I will fully recover, though the treating surgeon is hopeful.</p>
<p>Brad’s original post, before he yielded to the legal demands, follows.</p>
<p>We received a copy of this yesterday evening. Please note Tony is a friend of mine and this is genuine.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>To The Medical Board of Queensland,</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>My complaint is rather lengthy. It relates to an injury and subsequent treatment of that injury by various doctors and surgeons. I am not primarily complaining about any particular individual of the medical institution, rather, that I still have not been diagnosed and treated for my condition. I am desperately seeking diagnosis and a treatment. Some doctors may believe they have diagnosed my condition, but they have been wrong and this has been proven surgically. The best diagnosis available today is my own humble conjecture, which is terrifyingly inadequate.

On 28 July 2007, I suffered a severe inversion sprain to my right ankle. I&#39;d suffered a few previous sprains, but this one was much worse than others. I was kicking a football rather hard when I landed incorrectly. I was not weight-bearing for about 5-6 days. During that time I was a very fit athlete playing A1-grade tournament squash and was very active with many other hobbies.

Over the following months after the injury, I tried returning to sport and I could feel I had something wrong in my ankle. I hoped it would resolve, but it didn&#39;t. I could not put my joint into dorsiflexion due to a mechanical impingement and this resulted in muscle atrophy. Subsequently, I became very ill. Nevertheless, I pushed on with my sporting endeavours expecting my body to overcome the problem like it had many others in the past.

Eventually I conceded in January 2008 and sought help from Dr. Michael McEniery. We tried various treatments including a cortico-steroid injection and obtained MRI radiographs. Over time, this condition worsened to the point where I was forced to discontinue sport in May 2008. I have not been active since. I sought help from an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Greg Sterling, who prescribed a Broestrom Repair and medial arthroscopy since my complaint was mostly anteromedial.

At the time, I was very medically-illiterate and put much faith in medical doctors. I assumed a positive outcome from surgery, simply because I&#39;d had surgery in the past for various conditions and I was always better afterward. The procedure was performed on 15 September 2008 and the medial arthroscopy revealed deltoid ligament damage which was also repaired along with the ATFL and CFL.

I wore a cast for 2 weeks and an orthodic boot thereafter. Although I was in pretty intense pain, I&#39;d attributed this to the recent surgery and thought it would resolve. It didn&#39;t. In October 2008, I knew I was in big trouble – I had similar symptoms to pre-operative but they were now much worse. I immediately sought help from Dr. Greg Sterling who requested another MRI but in November 2008, could see nothing wrong. He said “see you in January 2009”. The prospect of waiting so long in agony was traumatising.

Around the same time, I&#39;d sought help from Dr. McEniery who claimed I was exaggerating my symptoms and attributing too much attention to my condition. This blatant oversight added further to my trauma – and he&#39;d almost convinced a member of my family of these falsehoods. I was suffering psychologically and I sought immediate help from Prince Charles Mental Health Unit.

I was discharged as an outpatient but I knew I was not mentally ill – I was in incredible pain and agony from a misdiagnosis by an orthopaedic surgeon. I set out to conquer the problem myself – scared and ill-educated on the subject matter – and was faced by the foreign medical protocols and language.

As my stress levels grew, I was admitted to the Prince Charles Mental Health Unit by Dr. John Reinders under a de facto ITO. I was also forced to take anti-psychotic medication. This is because of some of the desperate language I was using, for example, “do I have to operate on myself?” and Dr. Reinders felt I may be a harm to myself.

I&#39;d never been so low in my life. When taking anti-psychotic medication, you are very much unaware of your surroundings. It was only during a lull in the effect of the medication, that I decided I needed to get out of the hospital and do what I can for my ankle – I was convinced the doctors had erred and that this was a huge mistake. I requested a Psychiatric evaluation and was declared “in severe distress, but mentally healthy” and I was discharged.

I set about understanding ankle anatomy, conditions of the ankle and general medical protocols. I quickly learned that I had at least soft tissue impingement. Indeed, I had tissue trapped in the joint that was under permanent pressure due to the recent surgery – even when not weight bearing. This is as painful as you might imagine it to be and a little more given multiple pathologies.

I sought help from Dr. Andrew Wines (Foot &amp; Ankle Orthopaedic Surgeon) in Sydney who prescribed an arthroscopic debridement. This was performed under GA on 11 December 2008. To quote his remark, “you had a chunk of tissue about the size of my finger in there”. I was immediately weight bearing post-operative and the local aneasthetic provided some relief. As a result of this anaesthesis, I was under the false impression that my troubles were over. They weren&#39;t.

After a few days I knew I still had a severe and painful problem though I no longer had the problem of tissue impingement. It felt like I had bone impingement on dorsiflexion and I sought answers from medical literature. I eventually stumbled on Anteromedial Osseous Impingement Syndrome for which MRI radiography is inconclusive for diagnosis. I used my January 2009 appointment with Dr. Sterling to ask for a request form for a CAT radiograph and weight-bearing Xray. Dr. Sterling also made an appointment with Dr. Michael Lutz to determine if he could unravel this mysterious problem of mine.

Upon obtaining these radiographs, I saw immediately that I had a bone spur in the location of my pain. I sought assistance from Dr. Andrew Wines (again in Sydney) who agreed with me to some extent but wanted a second opinion in order to ensure he was not suffering a bias. I applaud this decision. I used my upcoming appointment with Dr. Lutz to achieve this second opinion. Dr. Lutz agreed that an open incision to excise osteophytes on my tibia may be appropriate and I was informed of the risks .

Dr. Wines performed an arthrotomic tibial ostectomy on 04 March 2009 under GA at Royal North Shore Hospital. I flew home the next day – I was weight bearing without assistance. Again, the anaesthetic provided a false belief that my problems were over.

Unfortunately, I still have the same problem I started with – I cannot put my ankle into dorsiflexion. Many doctors might attribute this to the recent surgery, but I know I am experiencing precisely the same symptoms that I have done for the last 18 months. Although the localised and extreme pain caused by a bone spur has been resolved, I still have bone impingement on dorsiflexion that is not localised. I also know that this is due to a very definite mechanical limitation, since I have had a Physiotherapist in the past attempt to push my joint past this point with intense force to no avail.

As a result of this inability for dorsiflexion, my muscles have atrophied up to my thoracic spine. Subsequently, I find breathing difficult and any position uncomfortable except for lying down. This has caused immense stress especially while I have maintained a full-time job (Computing Science Researcher) and I am considering indefinite unpaid sick leave. Unfortunately, a consequence of this is that I will no longer be able to afford regular flights to Sydney for treatment, radiographs and so on, therefore, I must continue the battle under all circumstances and despite exhaustion.

I have long maintained that my symptoms are only observable while I am weight-bearing and in an attempt at dorsiflexion. This means that surgeons who operate cannot check for resolution of these symptoms, MRI and CAT radiographs cannot exhibit them and the only weight-bearing Xray I have was not in dorsiflexion because the Radiographer would not allow it (images only per requesting doctor instructions).

Unfortunately, I still have quite a large battle ahead but I am at a complete loss with respect to how I should go about it and that is why I have written to you, my state medical authority.

Is there a radiographic machine available in Queensland that will exhibit my bone impingement while in dorsiflexion and while weight-bearing? Better still, is there a doctor who is prepared to do the hard work of figuring this problem out? I am more than willing to make many sacrifices to ensure it. These are rhetorical questions – I don&#39;t know what the right questions are.

I am desperately seeking a diagnosis and treatment, 19 months after an initial injury and I know that my time is limited with regard to the amount of stress and pain that I can continue to endure. This is simply unsustainable.

Please advise.

<p>The publisher(s) of this story oughtta be ashamed of themselves.

<p>Actually, I take it back. You see, it was a <strong>miracle</strong>. Yes, notice the use of the adverb, ‘miraculous’ in the second paragraph. Instead of contradicting our government’s established scientimplistic (yes, I made that up :)) understanding, the article exonerates itself by attributing the whole affair to a miracle.

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, Many of my readers may not be aware that all people over the age of 18 are required to vote in elections by law in Australia. The exceptions are (of course) the organisations with an artificially heightened religious status such as Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p>I was de-listed to vote years ago and when I contacted your Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to apply for conscientious objector status, I was told I needed to belong to a religious cult in order to be eligible and that I am not permitted to think for myself under Australian law. I resented this implication and I have since not ever enrolled to vote. Nevertheless, the AEC operator told me that to be a conscientious objector and at the same time, exist independently of a religious cult/organisation, that I simply should not enrol to vote – to break the law – go figure? I hadn’t voted before this time, since I had always submitted an empty voting ballot form. I won’t bore you with my somewhat complicated reasons why (relative to your comprehension skills that is).</p>
<p>But this is not the reason I write to you. No, it is the very rare victory that Science has had recently. I am writing to you to make a deal. I will forgive the implication that Australians are not permitted to think for themselves if you follow the lead of the UK government and even more, I will submit one vote for you! I will even forgive you for taking away my firearm licence those many years ago just because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_%28Australia%29">some psycho 2500km away went berzerk with a semi-automatic rifle</a>. I know you do not possess critical thinking skills Mr. Howard, and neither do your nemeses, but I will forgive you for that.</p>
<p>You see, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/25/id_not_science/">the UK government have recently announced that Intelligent Design has no part in a school that teaches Science</a>; how great is that for our society!? This announcement has tipped me over the edge and given me some hope – I will do just about anything to have the same for our vulnerable Australian children. Please Mr. Howard!</p>
<p>So, I implore you, please follow suit, for the sake of my children and their well-being if anything. But of course, I know all you care about at the end of the day is my vote and believe me, you will get it! I will even vote for a government; that’s how desperate I am to save my children from the Monotheistic attacks that are conducted so readily and openly in so many civilisations today, including the one that you currently govern.</p>
<p>So, how about it?</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Obstruction</title>

    <updated>2007-04-04T12:37:31Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 28 April 2006, I was charged by a police officer for obstruction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/">Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000</a> Section 444 (since amended to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s790.html">Section 790</a>). The police officer alleged at the time that my holding of a sign that reads ‘Police Speed Trap Ahead 50’ – with emphasis on the 50 indicating the speed limit in that area – constituted an offence, obstruction.</p>
<p>I subsequently entered a plea of <em>not guilty</em> (after one adjournment) and made several attempts to obtain a Brief of Evidence from the police prosecution. Their incompetence would normally astound me, but these days I just roll my eyes – in fact, a demonstration of competence itself <em>would</em> invoke surprise (know of one?). Of course, no brief was available, for days, then weeks, then months and in the meantime, I had spent countless hours on putting together a defence.</p>
<p>Finally, the day before the trial, still without a brief (<em>roll eyes now</em>), the police prosecutor rings me and attempts to negotiate – in the usual friendly/manipulative manner as expected. After the usual banter (trying to obtain information from me), I am offered a ‘guilty plea for no conviction’ deal, which I immediately decline and hang up the phone with, ‘see ya tomorrow mate’. I then travelled to the police station to request a brief of evidence, knowing I wouldn’t receive one, but adding to my record of attempts to obtain it, that I would be presenting to the magistrate the following day. A couple of hours later, I receive another phone call to be notified that the charge has been dropped.</p>
<p>This occurred for two reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The police prosecution was too incompetent to get their act together to pursue the charge</p></li>
<li><p>But <strong>most importantly</strong>, the police do not want to set a legal (lawful) precedent for this behaviour</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The police prosecution clearly believed that there was a strong possibility that my not guilty plea would pay off. If it were successful, a subsequent appearance on television (see the first one below) would have propagated the legality of this activity among the public and <strong>the police definitely do not want an informed public</strong> even if it means that I ‘get off’. Instead, it is best to leave the issue ‘blurred’ and continue pursuing ‘offenders’ such as myself, who otherwise do not know any better and enter a guilty plea on the day in court (I understand that many police officers genuinely believe that they are performing a public duty, but let’s leave that side issue).</p>
<p>Although I am not a lawyer, this activity is <strong>not</strong> illegal if it is executed correctly. I encourage any member of the public who is concerned about road-safety in Australia to engage in this lawful behaviour, although I do not accept any liability for any adverse consequences that you may encounter, including, among other things, a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>To engage in this behaviour legally in Queensland (other states may be similar), ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>stand well away from the police speed trap, a few hundred metres at least</p></li>
<li><p>if approached by <strong>anyone</strong>, do not offer comment under any circumstances</p></li>
<li><p>if approached by a police officer, he/she may request your name, address and may also request “evidence of the correctness of the stated name and address” (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s40.html">PPRA2000 Section 40</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Comply if you are asked for name and address, but under no circumstances should you offer further comment on the matter – police are very well trained at extracting this information to ensure your conviction, so it is up to you exercising discipline to keep yourself safe. This request is almost certainly a demand under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s41.html">PPRA 2000 Section 41</a> where the police officer “reasonably suspects the person has committed an offence”, even though you probably haven’t. Do not pursue this ambiguity with the police officer at the scene.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What about flashing vehicle headlights? If you flash your headlights to warn other motorists of an impending speed trap, a police officer will almost certainly issue you with an infringement notice of Rule 218 of the <a href="http://www.ntc.gov.au/ViewPage.aspx?page=A022075053009400200.com">Australia Road Rules</a> (<a href="http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/T/TrantOpRURR99.pdf">Transport Operations Regulation 1999</a> in Queensland). It is important in this case to fulfill your legal obligations (name, address and produce valid driver’s licence) but <strong>offer no other comment</strong> – why? Because you may not have committed an offence, that’s why.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Rule 218 of the ARR (Part 13 Division 1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>218 Using headlights on high-beam (1) The driver of a vehicle must not use the vehicle’s headlights on high-beam, or allow the vehicle’s headlights to be used on high-beam, if the driver is driving: (a) less than 200 metres behind a vehicle travelling in the same direction as the driver; or (b) less than 200 metres from an oncoming vehicle. Offence provision. Note High-beam and oncoming vehicle are defined in the dictionary. (2) However, if the driver is overtaking a vehicle, the driver may briefly switch the headlights from low-beam to high-beam immediately before the driver begins to overtake the vehicle. Note Low-beam and overtake are defined in the dictionary. <em>Diagrams follow</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your infringement notice is for part (1) of Section 218, but a police officer almost certainly will not ask you if you used your signals for part (2). Have you ever asked yourself why ADR (Australian Design Rules) compliant vehicles have a high-beam flasher switch? Of course, because it is entirely legal to flash your high-beam headlights under some circumstances.</p>
<p>If you wish to warn opposing traffic of an impending speed trap, ensure that you flash your headlights under legal circumstances – while overtaking a vehicle, briefly from low-beam to high-beam and immediately before overtaking the vehicle. Do not feel tempted to justify this action on the side of the road with a manipulative police officer! Simply enter your not guilty plea in the court and explain to the magistrate that you were acting legally and responsibly under Rule 218 of the ARR.</p>]]></summary>
