    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, on a forum, I saw a question regarding dirt bike areas around Brisbane. The question was motivated by a licenced rider on a registered motorcycle (WR450F), looking for areas to explore. I gave the following answer and I intend to update the answer with any improvements here.</p>
<hr />
<p>I do surveying as a hobby and have completed every state-owned track within about 250km of Brisbane (and some beyond, mostly northern Queensland). I have released that data openly under the OpenStreetMap project and I do public releases for use in Garmin devices. There are also phone apps for using this data. Some of those tracks are now not legally traversable, even for registered bikes. I started doing this several years ago.</p>
<p>The project has a map viewable at <a href="http://osm.org/">http://osm.org/</a> This map is also available on the <a href="http://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a> application for android. I have friends that run it on iphone, but every time I ask them how to recommend it to iphone users, I get some unusable answer, so <em>shrug</em> don’t know :)</p>
<p>For running it on Garmin devices, it requires a bit of technical understanding and my map build is rather custom. For example, I also like to walk up hills around here (e.g. Mt Barney), so my build includes a topographic map of those areas of interest. I also run a custom filter on the data before the build to correct errors according to my own standards. I prefer using a device with an accurate antenna (which is also very expensive!), but using a phone is just fine for user application (opposed to surveying).</p>
<p>Well, here are some riding spots, just from the top of my head. They all have various levels of difficulty and some of them are not always completely open to access. Sometimes they are not open at all (e.g. during the 2011 flood). Also note that there are some people who think that “giving away our secret riding areas is reprehensible!” Ignore them, they don’t realise it’s not a secret and never was. Self-importance bores me.</p>

<h3 id="north-of-brisbane">North of Brisbane</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-27.1162/152.6851">Mount Mee State Forest</a> Mostly fire trails now. Look out for 4x4. A lot of excellent enduro tracks that are now illegal to traverse. There is still one remaining, that can be used by motorcycles, but not 4x4. There is also a now-closed logging area, that the government has promised to reopen one day. We’ll see.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-26.9557/152.8996">Beerburrum State Forest</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-26.8806/152.8505">Peachester State Forest</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-26.8604/152.6645">Bellthorpe State Forest</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-26.7422/152.5282">Conondale National Park</a> Also, <a href="http://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/ride-report-mubbip-woo/index.html">here is a funny story about a ride in there last Christmas</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-26.5188/152.5939">Imbil State Forest</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-26.3605/152.5462">Amamoor State Forest</a> My favourite. Has some excellent and challenging enduro.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-26.0498/153.0461">Great Sandy National Park</a> Just like the label, lots of sand. Beach riding nearby too. Vehicle access permit is required in some areas (it’s cheap and easy to do online or purchase at Rainbow Beach).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-25.4509/153.0454">Great Sandy National Park (Fraser Island)</a> Well, it’s Fraser Island, so expect transport across the water and lots and lots and lots of sand. Permit required.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="south-of-brisbane">South of Brisbane</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/-28.1595/153.0525">Duck Creek Road</a> A mild and scenic ascent from Kerry up to O’Reilly’s. Excellent for a short trip out. I have seen less-experienced riders do it on a Triumph 1200. Look out for 4x4.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-28.3947/153.0416">Border Ranges National Park</a> A great day trip, scenic rainforest ride that extends for hours. Great for all rider skill levels. Dead easy for a learner, and good fun and scenic if you are not.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-28.5314/152.5193">Tooloom State Forest</a> Fire trails, with some harder off shoots.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="west-of-brisbane">West of Brisbane</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-28.5716/151.8079">Passchendaele State Forest</a> Another favourite. Most scenic and some challenging areas. Dropping your bike will cost some $$ on those rocks (it ain’t called the granite belt for nothing).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-28.8624/151.6590">Sundown National Park</a> Some harder trails and technical hill climbs. Rocky, very scenic. Look out for 4x4.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaGwoibQH38&amp;list=UUpDeRLsIqd041pueRjRUY0Q">Passchendaele State Forest 23 August 2014</a> We had the forest to ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Qpe7ZJZIg">My friend making a graceful entrance onto Rainbow Beach</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2DW6OzLXc8">Another friend on a fire trail with a 800XC in Mount Mee State Forest</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/45384135">My friend going arse up on his TTR250 at Emu Creek Extreme Retreat</a> This area is near Urbenville and Tooloom State Forest. It is a privately owned track and does not require a registered bike. Good if you have friends on motocrossers or something. My friend is in fact, upside-down in the water and after a few seconds of laughing, I started wondering if he was going to pop back up.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/29880420">Sundown National Park 3 years ago</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/24759031">Mount Mee State Forest 3 years ago</a> It is also my first video compilation, so I pressed all the fancy buttons.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I have certainly left areas some off, but let’s not be greedy :)</p>
<p>In any case, we should just meet up, work out what you are looking for and go for a ride. Unfortunately though, I am dealing with some health issues at the moment and hope to be back on two wheels by December.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Lane-Splitting in Australia.</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The subject of lane-splitting on a motorcycle often comes up in discussion. In Australia, the legality of lane-splitting is not absolute. For example, under some circumstances, such as two (or even three) motorcycles sharing a lane, this manouvre may be legal (further specifics apply). Under some other circumstances, lane-splitting is illegal.</p>
<p>Below are verbatim excerpts of Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995; Transport Operations (Road Use Management-Road Rules) Regulation 1999 that are relevant to lane-splitting. The name of this legislation is sometimes abbreviated to <em>TORUM</em>. TORUM applies to the state of Queensland and is derived from the Australian Road Rules (ARR).</p>
<p>Other Australian state and territory road use legislation is also derived from the ARR. Although these sections have been excerpted directly from TORUM, they can also be found in the ARR (under the same sections) and also in the road use legislation for other Australian states and territories.</p>

    <title>Safari Fuel Tanks -- Husqvarna TE510</title>
    <link href="http://blog.tmorris.net/posts/safari-fuel-tanks-husqvarna-te510/index.html" />
    <id>http://blog.tmorris.net/posts/safari-fuel-tanks-husqvarna-te510/index.html</id>
    <published>2010-10-26T19:57:36Z</published>
    <updated>2010-10-26T19:57:36Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.safaritanks.com.au/home/">Safari Tanks</a> recently released a long range fuel tank for the Husqvarna TE250/310/450/510 4-stroke enduro motorcycle. These bikes come standard with a 7.2 litre fuel tank, which simply does not cut the mustard, particularly for the thirsty 510.</p>
<p>I own a 2009 TE510 and a few weeks ago, I purchased <a href="http://www.safaritanks.com.au/home/14-Husqvarna/55-Husqvarna-TE250-310-450-510/flypage.tpl.html">this tank</a>. I was given the option of four colours: red, white, black or translucent. I chose white and I am happy with this choice. At this time, my bike had only done a few road kilometres and had not yet completed run-in.</p>
<p>Prior to my current TE510, I have owned other Husqvarna four stroke enduro motorcycles, but the TE510 is my first fuel-injected Husky. Below, I will attempt to write a balanced report of my experience with this product. Comments or questions are appreciated.</p>
<p>When it came time to fit the fuel tank, I found that the fuel pump did not install as specified and instead, could only fit in a 180 degree position. This is fine, except the supplied fuel line now did not reach the fuel tap outlet. Safari Tanks were quick to help me with this problem, spending a lot of time on the phone to resolve it (I live in Brisbane, about 1400km from Safari headquarters). Safari supplied me (express postage) with a suitable fuel line for the altered fuel pump fitting after I provided the measurements. This fuel line met my specifications and fit perfectly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://safaritanksusa.com/Husqvarna%20Front.pdf">supplied instructions</a> did not mention that the side radiator guards (not the fins) must be removed, however this was pretty obvious since the tank was not going on otherwise. The fuel tank appears to provide better protection from side impact than the original guards as well. The stock radiator fins did not require any modification at all.</p>
<p>I had trouble fitting the seat since the seat post was a little too far posterior, so I removed the seat post. This allowed the seat to install perfectly.</p>
<p>As for the performance of the tank I cannot speak highly enough. After recently spending a 3-day weekend riding in a <a href="http://osm.org/go/ueGXNhZb-">massive state forest</a>, I didn’t once come even close to hitting reserve on the 510, nor did I ever fill the tank (to keep weight down). The tank is simply enormous and this attracted comments from other riders, even though it blends well with the bike’s styling.</p>
<p>However, aside from the extra weight of carrying more fuel, the ergonomics of the tank are indistinguishable from the original tank and it allows you to adopt a correct riding position even in aggressive riding. I was quite impressed with this obviously clever design given the massive increase in fuel range. I expect this is because the extra fuel capacity is below the typical fuel tank position.</p>
<p>The (supplied) fittings and mountings for the tank are very strong, particularly for the frame mount, and even after some hard riding (to give you an idea, I wrote off the stock tyre in 15 minutes) there was no sign of fatigue.</p>
<p>After going riding with my mates on a 510 race-style enduro with a 7.2 litre tank, it’s usually me who is the first to complain of the need to return to a fuel supply. Not anymore, not even close. I’m very happy with the purchase of the Safari fuel tank and I would recommend it to anyone. After dealing with some minor fitting issues and the obvious attention given to my complaints, I have no doubt that Safari will have sorted out those issues by now. I would recommend this fuel tank to any fellow enthusiast of Husqvarna high-performance motorcycles.</p>
<p>Some pictures of the bike fitted with the tank follow.</p>
