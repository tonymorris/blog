An update on [IntelliJ IDEA + Scala utterly unusable](http://blog.tmorris.net/intellij-idea-scala-utterly-unusable/)





  1. Delete ~/.IntelliJIdea80 (oh well, I’m so used to specifying my settings over and over anyway).


  2. Start IntelliJ IDEA. **Do not open a project**


  3. Install the Scala plugin


  4. Open your project


  5. Observe not-useless usability



    1. There are still issues of not being able to open certain source folders (try it and see for yourself `scalaz.control` in Scalaz trunk)


    2. Other minor annoyances that needn’t be mentioned




I have repeated this twice on different machines (8823). Swapping steps 3 and 4 result in a rapid degeneration of usefulness to the point of absolute uselessness.

Thanks again for listening. I hope the usability trend reverses.
