<h1>Another Call to Genocide</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on April 12, 2008, in <a href="../../tags/Philosophy/index.html">Philosophy</a></div>

<p><em>Rabbi Yisrael Rosen, director of the Tsomet Institute</em> <a href="http://www.uruknet.de/?p=m42961&amp;hd=&amp;size=1&amp;l=e">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the Palestinians must be killed; men, women, infants, and even their beasts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh really? I didn’t know that! Thanks for letting me in on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosen asserted that there is evidence in the Torah to justify this stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh oh, an hallucinabating Rabbi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosen, an authority able to issue religious opinions for Jews…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean, people who do not possess the ability to think independently? I had a few of those commenting on my blog recently!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… wrote that Palestinians are like the nation of Amalekites that attacked the Israelite tribes on their way to Jerusalem after they had fled from Egypt under the leadership of Moses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you learn that at a nativity scene when you were being indoctrinated as a child?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He wrote that the Lord sent down in the Torah a ruling that allowed the Jews to kill the Amalekites,…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh the <strong>Lord</strong> did that? That’s OK then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true outrage is that most of those authorised to issue Jewish religious opinions support the view of Rabbi Rosen, as confirmed by Haaretz newspaper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">Well it has to be right then!</a> I bet the aforementioned commenters agree too, so it’s super spectacularly right! Oh wait, the truth value of the proposition was never open for analysis. Sorry Authority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The danger of these religious opinions lies in the fact that the religious authorities issuing them have wide respect among religious Jewish youth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean, your children subscribe to views of self-appointed authority without question? Hey, we have children that do that too! Does your indoctrination scheme masquerade as an education system like ours?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasil Taha, Arab Knesset member from the Tajammu Party led by Azmi Bishara, says that these religious opinions lead to the committal of crimes… Taha holds that the sectors of the Palestinian population most likely to be harmed by these religious opinions are those living in the various cities populated by both Jews and Palestinians, such as Haifa, Jaffa, Lod, Ramleh and Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel sick, but not as much as the hallucstibating Rabbi appears to be.</p>
<p>Burning question: Do Atheists have cause to be angry, despite not bearing arms to express this anger (due to a more grounded sense of morality?)?</p>
