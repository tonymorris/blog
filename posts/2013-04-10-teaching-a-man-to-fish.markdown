One of the very nice properties of type-safe, functional source code or API is that "an example usage of that API …" can almost [always] be answered with "anything that type-checks." Now for some people an for some libraries, this answer to the question is unsatisfactory, offensive even — they demand an example dammit!

But what they think I am going to do? Do they really think I have a library of examples in my head that I am holding hostage? Do they think that I am being spiteful toward them by withholding this library of knowledge that I possess and they do not? No, what I would do here is exactly what they are very capable of doing — they can find any type-checking program. In fact, this is the tool support that I aspire to so that I do not have to maintain a "library of examples" in my own head.

By appeasing their demand for "example usages of …", if I were to do sich an unfortunate thing, I am disservicing them. I am taking away their opportunity to develop the skills to answer this question for themselves. I am not even giving a good answer to the specifics of the question. It is not "a good example" of anything at all. It is the *process* by which the example is derived that is useful and nothing else.

So go on, try it. Create yourself a type-checking program. You may be a bit uncomfortable with the much higher degree of tool support in this environment. All I can say is, embrace it, cherish it even. Go.
