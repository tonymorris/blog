It is Saturday night and I get to sit at home and read a book by one my favourite authors, Sam Harris. Half my family are currently suffering from influenza, so I'm bound to the house tonight.

I thought I'd take a peek at a news website and I notice that Gwen Stefani is not permitted to wear "revealing costumes" when she performs in Malaysia because of a protest by a "Muslim student group". Apart from all the usual absurdities of theistic dogma (and particularly, Islamic and JudÃ¦o-Christian dogma), this quote cracked me up in laughter:


> 
She [Stefani] will abide by the Malaysian authorities' guidelines to ensure that her show will not be offensive to local sensibilities.



The funny part, from my humble perspective, is the use of the word "sensibility".

Watching a religious establishment manipulate its victims with such absurd and utterly transparent, blatant abuse of language usually causes me the most extreme alarm (because of the consequences to humanity), but on this night, after a couple of lonesome wines, I thought I'd take a laugh at just how sick and sad this world truly is. Sensibility!! Can you believe that!? You poor, sick bastards. Yes you, who has been robbed of the ability to think, yeah YOU.

Cheers :)
