Following is a list of software-related projects, venues, etc that include a 
Code of Conduct (or some similar variation) that purports "the right to not be
offended" or similar phrasing in such a way as to have adverse practical
consequences with regard to progressive, optimistic discourse.

The purpose of this list is to easily determine those projects, etc that may be
efficiently excluded from existence.
