### Proposed

To better handle casual players who arrive at the club, every tournament pairing will have two paired tournament players who are nominated prior to look after any casual players who arrive at the club. These two players will defer the start of their tournament game until a reasonable amount of time has passed (e.g. 30-40 minutes) after the normal start time, to ensure that there are no casual arrivals. Those two players may pass that time by, for example, playing a casual chess game.

Unanimously carried.

### Proposed

Club start time changes from 2000 UTC+10 to 1930 UTC+10. It is proposed that this will help bring in new players to the club.

Unanimously carried.

### Proposed

Put the membership form on the website. Andrew will send the updated membership form to Tony to put on the website.
