From [“Never again will I doom the earth because of man…” By: God  By J.D. Longstreet](http://westernfrontamerica.com/2008/09/08/doom-earth-man-god/).

The argument goes something like this. Man cannot destroy the world, since [Genesis 8:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%208:21&version=9;) says so. Therefore, Global Warming is a conspiracy by scientific illiterates. Yes I cringed in embarrassment too.

Ignoring the scary implications of the prevalence of this kind of superstitious crackpottery, consider the somewhat amusing (I thought so anyway) excerpt below:



> 
Then they [the Global Warming conspirators] use the guilt trip they have imposed on fellow human beings to shame us into completely altering the way we live. It is the oldest con game in the book. And the peoples of the planet are falling for it.




I wonder which book that might be :)
