<h1>Type-classes are nothing like interfaces</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on April  2, 2010, in <a href="../../tags/Programming/index.html">Programming</a></div>

<p>A beginner is confused about Haskell’s type-classes and so asks the question, “What is a type-class?” The response is often devastating, “You know, like Java or C# interfaces.” This wildly misleading statement can leave the beginner in a state of disrepair. I’ll tell you why but first I must emphasise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type-classes are nothing like interfaces <em>(emphasis on nothing)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haskell has something like interfaces. They are called data types and are expressed using the <code>data</code> or <code>newtype</code> keywords. Languages like Java/C# have nothing like type-classes; there is not even a close analogy. Consider for example, Java’s <code>[Comparator](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html)</code> interface. We would express this in Haskell like so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode Haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">newtype</span> <span class="dt">Comparator</span> a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">C</span> {<span class="ot"> compare ::</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> }</code></pre>
<p>Then if we wanted to sort a list, the type would be <code>sort :: Comparator a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>. Notice the <em>explicit</em> passing of the <code>Comparator</code> that would be required at the call site. This is just like Java.</p>
<p>Now suppose we did something that Java cannot do. We used a type-class.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode Haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Comparator</span> a <span class="kw">where</span>
<span class="ot">  compare ::</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Int</span></code></pre>
<p>The type for sorting a list now becomes <code>sort :: Comparator a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>. This is just like the previous signature except for the way the left-most arrow is written. This is an important distinction. When the caller uses this function, it <em>implicitly</em> passes the <code>Comparator</code>. Also, the type-class instance is decoupled from the data type. These are essential properties of type-classes. Indeed, it is its single-most defining property and since Java/C# have nothing like this, then it has nothing like type-classes.</p>
<p>Scala has implicit parameters which give you the ability to implement the essential property of type-classes (and more). Therefore, Scala does have something very much like type-classes. This is evident in a library such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scalaz">Scalaz</a>.</p>
<p>But let’s try to save the idea.</p>
<p>Java has implicit type-conversion by virtue of inheritance. For example, a method that accepts a <code>T</code> can be passed a <code>U</code> and its implicit conversion to a <code>T</code> is denoted by the way of <code>U extends T</code>. Notice that no side-effect can be performed during this conversion. This is unlike Scala’s implicit where it’s simply a bad idea, not enforced (Scala also has inheritance like Java).</p>
<p>So, if you are to say type-classes are like anything in these languages, it’s sort-of-like-yeah-ok-not-really inheritance. However, I’m sure you’ll agree, this will only cause confusion for the poor beginner, so it’s best not to draw the analogy at all.</p>
<p>Type-classes are a new concept to people coming from Java/C#. It is most appropriate to explain it as a new concept. I often use the contention between using <code>java.util.Comparable</code>, where the caller has the convenience of implicitly pass the implementation by way of inheritance but inconvenience of carrying the implementation with the data type versus using <code>java.util.Comparator</code> where the caller has the convenience of decoupling the implementation from the data type but requiring explicit passing at the call site. Type-classes (and Scala implicits) resolve this contention with a new concept.</p>
