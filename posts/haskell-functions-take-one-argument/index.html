<h1>Haskell Functions Take One Argument</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on March  4, 2014, in <a href="../../tags/Haskell/index.html">Haskell</a>, <a href="../../tags/Function/index.html">Function</a>, <a href="../../tags/Programming/index.html">Programming</a>, <a href="../../tags/Functional%20Programming/index.html">Functional Programming</a>, <a href="../../tags/Teaching/index.html">Teaching</a></div>

<p>I teach functional programming. It is a significant part of my job. I enjoy it a lot and it is extremely challenging; in my opinion, much more so than learning functional programming itself.</p>
<p>I use the Haskell programming language for teaching functional programming. I like to emphasise the learning and construction of <em>concepts</em> over learning the details of any specific programming language. I am not into teaching programming languages; I really find that boring, uneventful and unhelpful for all involved. However, learning some of the intricacies of Haskell itself is inevitable. It doesn’t take long though and is very much worth the investment of effort if you aspire to learning concepts.</p>
<p>That is to say, using (almost all) other programming languages for this objective is a false economy that is not even a close call. One could spent many weeks or even years demanding to articulate concepts in a specific programming language, only to struggle precisely because that language resists an accurate expression and formation of that concept. I have seen this an overwhelming number of times. It is often supported by the fallacy of false compromise, “but all languages are Turing-complete, so I am going to use JavaScript, which even has first-class functions, in order to come to understand what monad means.”</p>
<p>No, you won’t, I absolutely insist and promise.</p>
<p>This is all somewhat beside the point of this post though. The point is that there is a fact, which often comes up in teaching, that can be expressed briefly and concisely. It requires no exceptions, apologies or approximations. I would like to state this fact and explain some of the nomenclature that surrounds this fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All functions in the Haskell programming language take exactly one argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fact is certain to come up early on in teaching. If a student comes to trust then follow this fact, then progress will be unhindered. That is because it is an absolute fact. However, even though a student may initially convince themselves of this fact, it has been my experience that they will renege on it at some time in the future.</p>
<p>The use of casual terminology such as the following surely helps to set this trap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examining the signature to the <code>map</code> function, we see that it takes <em>two arguments</em>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode Haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">map<span class="ot"> ::</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">List</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">List</span> b</code></pre></div>
<p>We will then talk about the <em>first argument</em> and the <em>second argument</em> as if there even is such a thing.</p>
<p>However, the truth of the original fact has not changed. Look at it, just sitting there, saying nothing, being all shiny and true. So how could all functions take one argument, while we simultaneously and casually talk about a “second argument”? Are we just telling great big lies? Have we made a mistake?</p>
<p>The problem is our vocabulary. In our spoken words, we are using an <strong>approximation</strong> of fact and superficially, it looks like a blatant contradiction. Let us expand our approximation to more obviously coincide with our statement of fact. I have added some annotation in [brackets].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examining the signature to the <code>map</code> function, we see that it is a function [therefore, it definitely takes one argument]. That argument is of the type <code>(a -&gt; b)</code> [which is also a function]. The return type of the <code>map</code> function is <code>(List a -&gt; List b)</code> which is a function and [since it is a function] takes one argument. That argument is of the type <code>(List a)</code> and it returns a value [not a function]. That value is of the type <code>List b</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say out loud “the <code>map</code> function takes two arguments”, we are approximating for the above expansion. It is important to understand what we really mean here.</p>
<p>During my teaching, I will often make a deal with students; I will use the terser vocabulary with you and I will even let you use it, however, if at any moment you violate our understanding of its proper meaning, I will rip it out from under you and demand that you use the full expansion. Almost always, the student will agree to this deal.</p>
<p>Some time after having made this deal, I will hear the following question. Given, for example, this solution to an exercise:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode Haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">flatten <span class="ot">::</span>
  <span class="dt">List</span> (<span class="dt">List</span> a)
  <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">List</span> a
flatten <span class="fu">=</span>
  foldRight (<span class="fu">++</span>) <span class="dt">Nil</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I will hear this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait a minute, you only passed two arguments to <code>foldRight</code>, however, we have seen that it takes three. How could this possibly work!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another example of the question. Given this solution:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode Haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">filter <span class="ot">::</span>
  (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span>)
  <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">List</span> a
  <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">List</span> a
filter f <span class="fu">=</span>
  foldRight (\a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="kw">if</span> f a <span class="kw">then</span> (a<span class="fu">:.</span>) <span class="kw">else</span> id) <span class="dt">Nil</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I will hear this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The argument to <code>foldRight</code> (which is itself a function) takes two arguments, however, the function you passed to <code>foldRight</code> has been specified to take only one (which you have called <code>a</code>). How could this even work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is at this moment that I hand out an infringement notice under our agreed penal code for the offence of:</p>
<pre><code>Section 1.1
Failure to Accept that All Haskell Functions Take One Argument

Penalty
Temporary Incarceration at Square One with release at the discretion of an
appointed Probation Officer</code></pre>
<p>I understand that in a learning environment, it may be easy to demonstrate and subsequently accept this fact, then later fall afoul when previously learned facts interfere with this most recent one. The purpose of going back to square one and starting again is to properly internalise this fact. It is an important one, not just for the Haskell programming language, but for Functional Programming in general.</p>
<p>Joking aside, the purpose of this post is to help reconcile these observations. There is a recipe to disentanglement. If you find yourself in this situation, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Revert back to the fact of matter; all Haskell functions always take one argument. There is never an exception to this rule (so you cannot possibly be observing one!).</li>
<li>From this starting position, reason about your observations with this fact in mind, even if it is a little clumsy at first. After some repetitions, this clumsiness will disappear. Persevere with it for now.</li>
<li>Introspect on the thought process that led you into that trap to begin with. This will help you in the future as you begin to trust that principled thinking will resolve these kinds of conflicts. It can be initially clumsy, even to the point of resisting on that basis, but that is a one-time penalty which quickly speeds up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
