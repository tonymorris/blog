I have found that those who advocate for the practicality of Java as a programming language for solving software problems invariably have an incredibly poor understanding of programming language theory and poor general problem solving skills. However, almost always, an even poorer understanding of the Java programming language itself is most prominent.

Consequently, one cannot have a reasonable discussion about the merits of problem solving, using the Java programming language, or programming languages in general. However, one hopes that this sample set is biased and so one continues the search for a counter-example.

This is lamentable.
