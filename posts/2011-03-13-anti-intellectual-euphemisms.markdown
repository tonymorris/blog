I see this a lot, especially in programming forums.



	
  * Using the word _simple_, _natural_, _pragmatic_, _real world_ or _intuitive_ to mean **"I am able to understand this."**

	
  * Conversely, using the word _complex_, _unnatural_, _academic_, _"your world"_ or _unintuitive_ to mean **"I am not able nor am I willing to invest the effort to come to understand this."**


If someone does this, I will politely request that it stops, since it crushes any potential useful discussion.
