tags: Motorcycling, KTM, Supermoto
---

This article is a description of the conversion of a 2014 KTM 690 Enduro R to a
Supermoto with 17" wheels. Two goals ar kept in mind:

1. It is easy to go back to Enduro configuration.

2. It is easy to go back to factory. This refers to the minimising the
   irreversible modification of factory parts.

Part names and numbers will be provided.

If you would like me to do this conversion for on your bike and you are able to
transport your motorcycle to Brisbane, please email me and I will be happy to
help you.

### Motorcycle models

The motorcycle was already heavily modified (details below). It is an Australian
version of the KTM 690 Enduro R, which closely resembles the EU version. I would
expect that  the description here would apply, without alternation, to US
models.

I also expect that this description would apply to earlier year models, with
exception for taking into account the ABS. The use of ABS in the 2014 model only
changes the following facts:

*   There is no need to purchase the ABS sensor rings for the supermoto wheels.

*   The earlier models use different wheel bushing/spacer widths, which:

    *   are supplied with the supermoto wheels for all year models

    *   required customisation for the rear wheel in my case anyway

### Wheels

In August 2014, I purchased the front wheel, rear wheel and cush-drive hub with
44T sprocket from
[warp9racing.com](http://www.warp9racing.com/sm_wheels_KTM.html):

*   ASSEMBLED KTM 690 FRONT WHEEL - 17"X3.50" BLACK HUB / BLACK RIM / SILVER
    SPOKES WITH SILVER NIPPLES INCLUDES 300MM FLOATING ROTOR WITH SPACERS 
  

    `USD468.00`

*    ASSEMBLED KTM 690 ENDURO REAR WHEEL - 17"X4.25" ORANGE HUB / BLACK RIM / 
     SILVER SPOKES WITH SILVER NIPPLES INCLUDES ROTOR
  
     `USD468.00`
  
*    KTM 690 CUSH DRIVE WITH SROPCKET (USES OEM RUBBERS) 44T 
     
     `USD139.00`

----

When the wheels arrived, they looked like this:

Note that the wheels included:

* disc brakes

* wheel bushings/spacers

### ABS Sensor Rings

I chose to buy a second set of ABS sensor rings and factory bolts to use on the
supermoto wheels, without having to remove them whenever I wanted to go back to
Enduro configuration.

*    **1x** SENSOR WHEEL FRONT (KTM part `60142020000`)

     `USD23.46`

*    **1x** SENSOR WHEEL ABS REAR (KTM part `76542021000`)

     `USD23.36`

*    **15x** ZYL.SCHRAUBE DIN14580 M6X16 (KTM part `014580060166S`)

     `USD11.25` (`USD0.79` each)

----

Each ABS sensor requires six (6) of the Zylinderkopf DIN14580 TORX bolts. I
purchased a total of fifteen (15) so that I had some spares.

The [KTM 690 service manual](https://github.com/tonymorris/ktm690/blob/master/manuals.md)[^1]
specifies the following for these bolts:

*   Tighten to 14Nm (10.3 lbfÂ·ft) torque 

*   Use Loctite 243

*   The lettering on the ABS sensor wheel is located on the outside.

[^1]: This service manual is made available online, in protest to a lack of
response from KTM Australia, regarding a defective service manual product in
violation of Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer
Act 2010. Read more

After fitment of the ABS sensor rings, the wheels now look like this:

# Tyres

I fitted Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres to the rims. The tyre sizes were chosen for
their application, however, it was later learned that it is also important for
fitment. Specifically, the front tyre is at the limit of maximum width for a
proper fitment.

I also used tubes and rim bands.

* Front `150/60-ZR17`

* Rear `120/70-ZR17`

# Rear Wheel Fitment

Using the warp9racing supplied bushings, I was able to fit the rear wheel,
however, it was clearly malaligned, since

*   the inside brake pad friction was preventing wheel rotation

*   the ABS sensor ring bolt heads fouled the rear brake caliper

    <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zaIwNkG.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zaIwNkG.jpg" alt="warp9racing supermoto rear wheel, malaligned" style="height: 1033px;"/></a>

I removed the rear wheel and measured the distance from the wheel hub shaft
(against which the bushings sit) to surface of the ABS sensor ring.

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/L5qWMcN.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/L5qWMcN.jpg" alt="measure malaligned rear wheel" style="width: 688px;"/></a>

I first measured this distance, using the factory wheel. The resulting distance
is `18.93mm`.

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yGZbZ9a.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yGZbZ9a.jpg" alt="measure factory rear wheel" style="height: 688px;"/></a>

Next, I measured the same distance for the warp9racing supplied rear wheel. The
resulting distance is `20.84mm`.

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/VToToXx.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VToToXx.jpg" alt="measure warp9racing rear wheel" style="height: 688px;"/></a>

I then double-checked all measurements, supplied parts and or other possible 
errors. I was left to conclude that the supplied rear wheel would not fit this
motorcycle. I sent an email to warp9racing.com, while I set about making my own
spacers that would put the rear wheel in its appropriate position, which is an 
extra `2mm`.

I have **still** not heard from warp9racing since sending that email (20
December 2014), which is disappointing. Everything else about the company had
been great, including the quality of the wheels. Unfortunately, since they now
had my money, I was screwed. It was a shame to learn that warp9racing would not
support their product. I suspect that nobody had actually successfully fitted
these wheels to the 2014 model.

Oh well, plan B.

----

Fortunately, I know an excellent machinist. Given the two supplied bushings, I
asked him to add `2mm` to the right-sided one and shave `2mm` from the
left-sided one.

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/eBL2HKX.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eBL2HKX.jpg" alt="warp9racing bushings, before alteration" style="width: 688px;"/></a>

Since he is awesome, this was not a problem and I had new bushings within a
couple of hours.

I used the existing cush-drive rubber dampers and fitted them to the supermoto
hub. This requires no bolts or fixings as they just slot right in. Next, I
fitted the warp9racing supplied 44T sprocket and cush-drive into the hub. Again,
no fixings are required. Reassembling the rear wheel, with the custom-made
bushings, and it all slotted in perfectly. The alignment of the drive-chain and
brake calipers was perfect.

### Front Wheel Fitment

For the front wheel, I did not have the same problems with the bushings/spacers
as I had for the rear wheel. In this case, the wheel fitted perfectly with the 
supplied spacers.

However, since the front wheel is wider than factory, it fouls on the fork leg
protectors on both sides as well as the front brake hose. The fork leg
protectors are important, as the left one retains the front brake hose and
speedometer wire.

Importantly, even though at rest the front wheel does not contact the front
brake hose, *under motion, there is fouling*. Therefore, it is important to
modify the left fork leg protector for clear the tyre as well as mount the front
brake hose and speedometer wire away from the tyre.

The fork leg protectors can be modified by cutting a notch with a utility knife.
The part number for the fork leg protectors, if you choose to have another set,
is `7800109420030`.

Here is the modification of the right fork leg protector:

<!--

- confirmed to work; ABS (including bad fuel dongle (60312953000) with rear wheel off), 

1. Take off headlight assembly ( 2 torx bolts on the side near the blinkers)
2. Disconnect the connection to the speedo (white attachment with about 16 or so wires going into it)
3. Pull out the black clip that holds the wires in place
4. Pull out the all Brown wire (tape it off)
5. Re-connect the instrument cluster wires
6. Turn ignition on
7. Change mode to Odo 1
8. Hold mode button for 10 seconds
9. The wheel length will show up now, press mode/ set to change the value to 1870
10. Hold mode and set button simultaneously to set it
11. Re-connect everything and you're good to go...
