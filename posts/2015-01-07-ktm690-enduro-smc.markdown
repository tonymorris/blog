This article is a description of the conversion of a 2014 KTM 690 Enduro R to a
Supermoto with 17" wheels. Two goals ar kept in mind:

1. It is easy to go back to Enduro configuration.

2. It is easy to go back to factory. This refers to the minimising the
   irreversible modification of factory parts.

Part names and numbers will be provided.

If you would like me to do this conversion for on your bike and you are able to
transport your motorcycle to Brisbane, please email me and I will be happy to
help you.

### Motorcycle models

The motorcycle was already heavily modified. It is an Australian version of the
KTM 690 Enduro R, which closely resembles the EU version. I would expect that 
the description here would apply, without alternation, to US models.

I also expect that this description would apply to earlier year models, with
exception for taking into account the ABS. The use of ABS in the 2014 model only
changes the following facts:

*   There is no need to purchase the ABS sensor rings for the supermoto wheels.

*   The earlier models use different wheel spacer widths, which:

    *   are supplied with the supermoto wheels for all year models

    *   required customisation for the rear wheel in my case anyway

### Wheels

In August 2014, I purchased the front wheel, rear wheel and cush-drive hub with
44T sprocket from
[warp9racing.com](http://www.warp9racing.com/sm_wheels_KTM.html):

*   ASSEMBLED KTM 690 FRONT WHEEL - 17"X3.50" BLACK HUB / BLACK RIM / SILVER
    SPOKES WITH SILVER NIPPLES INCLUDES 300MM FLOATING ROTOR WITH SPACERS 
  

    `USD468.00`

*    ASSEMBLED KTM 690 ENDURO REAR WHEEL - 17"X4.25" ORANGE HUB / BLACK RIM / 
     SILVER SPOKES WITH SILVER NIPPLES INCLUDES ROTOR
  
     `USD468.00`
  
*    KTM 690 CUSH DRIVE WITH SROPCKET (USES OEM RUBBERS) 44T 
     
     `USD139.00`

When the wheels arrived, they looked like this:

Note that the wheels included:

* disc brakes

* wheel spacers

### ABS Sensor Rings

I chose to buy a second set of ABS sensor rings and factory bolts to use on the
supermoto wheels, without having to remove them whenever I wanted to go back to
Enduro configuration.

*    **1x** SENSOR WHEEL FRONT (KTM part `60142020000`)

     `USD23.46`

*    **1x** SENSOR WHEEL ABS REAR (KTM part `76542021000`)

     `USD23.36`

*    **15x** ZYL.SCHRAUBE DIN14580 M6X16 (KTM part `014580060166S`)

     `USD11.25` (`USD0.79` each)

----

Each ABS sensor requires six (6) of the Zylinderkopf DIN14580 TORX bolts. I
purchased a total of fifteen (15) so that I had some spares.

The [KTM 690 service manual](https://github.com/tonymorris/ktm690/blob/master/manuals.md)[^1]
specifies the following for these bolts:

* Tighten to 14Nm (10.3 lbfÂ·ft) torque 

* Use Loctite 243

* The lettering on the ABS sensor wheel is located on the outside.

[^1]: This service manual is made available online, in protest to a lack of
response from KTM Australia, regarding a defective service manual product in
violation of Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer
Act 2010. Read more

After fitment of the ABS sensor rings, the wheels now look like this:
