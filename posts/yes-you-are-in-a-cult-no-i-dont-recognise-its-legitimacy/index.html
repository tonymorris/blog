<h1>Yes you are in a cult, no I don’t recognise its legitimacy</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on April  5, 2008, in <a href="../../tags/Programming/index.html">Programming</a></div>

<p>I was trolled yesterday – I think – I still don’t quite know what “troll” means, since it seems to be a universally applicable verb to describe an action that you dislike. Maybe I wasn’t trolled. I was in the #ocaml programming language channel when a user started displaying an ignorance of the Haskell programming language. I made a small effort to point out that the propositions being put forward were incorrect, but it turns out that “of course I would say that, I am a Haskeller” and so the truth value of the propositions were never explored.</p>
<p><strong>No, I am not a Haskeller.</strong> I am not an anti-Java, O’Caml hating, Scala using Haskell worshipper. I completely reject this attempt to assign cult status to the various programming languages. As a matter of fact, I completely reject the existence of the concept of X Programmer for any value of X such that X is an element of the set of all computer programming languages. Correct, Java programmers <strong>do not exist</strong>. Try telling that to your local recruitment agent.</p>
<p>The corporations are having a field day, while amateurs continue to repeat the many different brand/meme names. “Oh hi, I am a C# Programmer, what religion… err programming language fraternity do you belong to?”. My criticisms of Java do not stem from a personal distaste or apostasy; they stem from the fact that it is indeed, far removed from anything useful, practical or resembling soundness in the practice of computer programming.</p>
<p>Can you imagine two motor mechanics discussing their day jobs where one says, “I am an NGK spark plug installer”, to which the other replies, “oh, I am a Champion spark plug installer, but I use NGK on my own vehicle”? It is this degree of absurdity that I assign to any notion of Java Programmer, Haskeller or what-have-you. It is simply and extremely ridiculous. No really, it is. I won’t pretend otherwise despite any scoffing.</p>
<p>Take for example, the distinction between Java and C#, which is almost zero, <em>in the greater scheme of computer programming language theory</em>. What benefit does distinguishing a “C# Programmer” from a “Java Programmer” give? It serves only to resemble status and cult membership. They are both utterly useless as computer programming languages (yes, this is despite their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">popularity</a>). Members of both of these cults will scorn at this proposition simply because it appears provocative and causes offence – not because there is evidence to the contrary (there is an enormous amount of evidence supporting the affirmative position, but that’s another topic). What if it is true?</p>
<p>I predict that the many members of the current (why was I born in this era?!) anti-intellectualism establishment probably wouldn’t read this rant to this point, so I’m probably preaching to the choir when I point out that the practice of computer programming is founded on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">various</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard">fields</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic">of</a> mathematics.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the latest advertisement on msdn.com or whatever bullshit marketing material you subscribe to? Nothing. Not a bit. So no, I’m not in your cult, I’m not in cults that rival you, I’m not in a cult that considers itself superior or inferior to yours. I’m an independent thinker.</p>
<p>Your inability to see beyond subscription to cleverly-constructed brand naming is complete bullshit, that’s what it is.</p>
