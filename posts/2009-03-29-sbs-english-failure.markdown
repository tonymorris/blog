I sometimes watch the [SBS television station](http://www.sbs.com.au/) -- the content is generally of a higher standard than commercial stations with a greater display of intellectual rigour.

However, there is a Ticketek advertisement on this station with a caption, "What do you think your doing?".

_Ugh._
