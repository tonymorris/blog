While the Dawkins argument against Agnosticism is the usual and incredibly weak and contradictory proposition with a touch of cognitive dissonance (sound familiar Dawkins?), I must otherwise extend an overriding congratulations and approval of any concise, calculated and importantly, successful, attack against Abrahamic theism. I strongly urge anyone of any faith to consider [The God Delusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion) if only to learn what "all the fuss is about", but do approach with extreme scepticism - as I'd imagine Dawkins himself would recommend.
