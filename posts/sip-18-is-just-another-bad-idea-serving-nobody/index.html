<h1>SIP-18 is just another bad idea serving nobody</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on May 11, 2012, in <a href="../../tags/Programming/index.html">Programming</a></div>

<p>SIP-18 is a bad idea because it makes awful assumptions about what is in the interest of language newcomers. I have had no shortage of unsolicited advice of how to teach, most of it in layers of wrongness, so I am acutely aware of the sheer quantity of this kind of advice. Please refrain for now. This is only my opinion, because it has been asked of me more than twice.</p>
<p>SIP-18 (and the Scala collections library for that matter) is no different to Haskell’s (dreaded) monomorphism restriction (DMR). The DMR was introduced specifically because of another chronically bold over-estimate of one’s ability to understand the process of learning. It is now an undesired language issue that hinders all users, <strong>especially newcomers</strong>. In other words, it serves nobody’s interest, hinders everyone’s interest and especially, the interest of those for whom it was meant to serve. You need only spend a short period of time with newcomers to Haskell to be overwhelmed by the prominence of this fact.</p>
<p>I can hear the pragmatists in the background muttering something about trade-offs, not being so extreme and keeping it relevant to the real world and blah blah blah, <em>insert the usual pragmatist bullshit here</em>. There is nothing to be traded off when you offer to take $5 from me for the low cost of $10. Now stop it and get your head out of the clouds so I can talk to you sensibly.</p>
<p>Not only does SIP-18 not help newcomers at all, it helps nobody, hinders everybody and <strong>especially newcomers</strong>. It is not a trade-off, it is not a good idea; it is simply a bold, severely misguided assertion about how learning takes place – it’s not even an approximation. I have seen only scant pseudo-psychology to support its existence, which obviates its predictable failure.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Scala guys will work this out, but if Scala’s remarkable precision to repeat historical mistakes is anything to go by, I do not hold high hopes.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking.</p>
