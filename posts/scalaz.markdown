[Scalaz](http://code.google.com/p/scalaz) is a library written using the Scala Programming Language and tested using [ScalaCheck](http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/) (maintained by myself and Rickard Nilsson) automated specification-based testing. It is released under a BSD open source licence.

**Features include:**



  
  * The [Either](http://projects.workingmouse.com/public/scalaz/artifacts/2.1/scaladoc/scalaz/Either.html) Algebraic Data Type and general functions over that type

  
  * [Enhanced Option](http://projects.workingmouse.com/public/scalaz/artifacts/2.1/scaladoc/scalaz/Maybe.html) type

  
  * Control package (Functor, Monad, MonadPlus, Foldable, etc.)

  
  * Transparent memoisation, loosley inspired by a [paper](http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/Papers/weak.ps.gz) written by Simon Peyton-Jones, Simon Marlow, and Conal Elliott (IFL '99) titled, "Stretching the storage manager: weak pointers and stable names in Haskell"

  
  * Validation package for web form field validation (using Either and monadic functions across it)
