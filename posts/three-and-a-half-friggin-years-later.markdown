The result of:




  * The purchase and consumption of 31 medical text books on lower limb orthopaedics, neurology, neuro and spinal surgery and radiology.


  * Uncountable subscriptions to medical journals.


  * 18 MRIs, 4 CAT scans, 3 XRAY scans, 3 bone scans.


  * 12 surgical procedures; 8 to the lower limb, 3 to the lumbar spine. 1 (successfully) minor procedure performed by myself for a medical emergency for which acknowledgement was initially refused and later accepted after surgical extraction of foreign body.


  * 29 doctors


  * AU$130K _(total estimated)_


  * Having been misdiagnosed by a not-so-clever person named Dr Leigh Atkinson, including the suggestion that my chronic pain is "caused by the holy ghost." Yes, seriously, he said this -- while also in the room with a qualified medical professional (whom he called delusional in the same rant). He also claimed that I did not have Entrapment Neuropathy of SPN when I told him I strongly suspected it. I did -- surgically verified by lower limb orthopaedic specialist (November 2009).


  * Having been repeatedly told for nearly two years by Dr Michael McEniery, who would threaten to sue me again if I was to call him incompetent or dangerous (even though this might be my genuinely held opinion based on substantiated fact and so he would lose) that I am obsessing about a minor condition, requiring no medical intervention, and that this obsession is because of the athletic demands of myself and my coach.


  * Having executed a partially-successful mission to demand immediate medical attention in March 2009 at significant expense.



I have successfully and single-handedly diagnosed:


  * Entrapment Neuropathy of the Superficial Peroneal Nerve, 10cm proximal to lateral malleolus (unilateral).


  * Foraminal Stenosis of the Fifth Lumbar (L5) Nerve Root (unilateral).


  * Spinal instability (Spondylolisthesis) at Fifth Lumbar (L5).


  * Withdrawal from morphine and oxycodone after immediate cessation.



These conditions were caused by a single acute sporting injury in July 2007. I have been treated for all.

PS: This is why I sometimes demonstrate low tolerance for stupidity and/or failure or refusal to entertain the possibility of thinking. People get hurt. No, I am not sorry.
