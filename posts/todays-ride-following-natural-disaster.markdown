Fernvale bridge 32 hours after peaking during major flood. The edge of the water is 830 metres from the bridge which is typically used to traverse the river. The width of the river is estimated to be over 1.5km.

The dried mud on the bitumen road indicates the peak height that was reached.

Note the street sign indicating a side street ahead. Coominya State School lies completely submerged in the water ahead.

The marker denotes the edge of the water as seen in the video to within a few metres.
