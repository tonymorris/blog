<h1>Three and a half friggin years later</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on April 30, 2011, in <a href="../../tags/Health/index.html">Health</a></div>

<p>The result of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The purchase and consumption of 31 medical text books on lower limb orthopaedics, neurology, neuro and spinal surgery and radiology.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncountable subscriptions to medical journals.</p></li>
<li><p>18 MRIs, 4 CAT scans, 3 XRAY scans, 3 bone scans.</p></li>
<li><p>12 surgical procedures; 8 to the lower limb, 3 to the lumbar spine. 1 (successfully) minor procedure performed by myself for a medical emergency for which acknowledgement was initially refused and later accepted after surgical extraction of foreign body.</p></li>
<li><p>29 doctors</p></li>
<li><p>AU$130K <em>(total estimated)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Having been misdiagnosed by a not-so-clever person named Dr Leigh Atkinson, including the suggestion that my chronic pain is “caused by the holy ghost.” Yes, seriously, he said this – while also in the room with a qualified medical professional (whom he called delusional in the same rant). He also claimed that I did not have Entrapment Neuropathy of SPN when I told him I strongly suspected it. I did – surgically verified by lower limb orthopaedic specialist (November 2009).</p></li>
<li><p>Having been repeatedly told for nearly two years by Dr Michael McEniery, who would threaten to sue me again if I was to call him incompetent or dangerous (even though this might be my genuinely held opinion based on substantiated fact and so he would lose) that I am obsessing about a minor condition, requiring no medical intervention, and that this obsession is because of the athletic demands of myself and my coach.</p></li>
<li><p>Having executed a partially-successful mission to demand immediate medical attention in March 2009 at significant expense.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I have successfully and single-handedly diagnosed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Entrapment Neuropathy of the Superficial Peroneal Nerve, 10cm proximal to lateral malleolus (unilateral).</p></li>
<li><p>Foraminal Stenosis of the Fifth Lumbar (L5) Nerve Root (unilateral).</p></li>
<li><p>Spinal instability (Spondylolisthesis) at Fifth Lumbar (L5).</p></li>
<li><p>Withdrawal from morphine and oxycodone after immediate cessation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions were caused by a single acute sporting injury in July 2007. I have been treated for all.</p>

<p>PS: This is why I sometimes demonstrate low tolerance for stupidity and/or failure or refusal to entertain the possibility of thinking. People get hurt. No, I am not sorry.</p>
