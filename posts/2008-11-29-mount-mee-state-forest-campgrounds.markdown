I am an avid GPS user and I visit [Mount Mee State Forest](http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/park/index.cgi?parkid=63) regularly on my dirt bike (Husqvarna TE450). I encounter queries on forums for the locations of [the campgrounds in this forest](http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/mount_mee_state_forest_and_forest_reserve__camping_information/), so here they are:

Neurum Creek Campground
-27.061853° 152.696228°
_-27°03'42.67" 152°41'46.42"_

Archer Campground
-27.016317° 152.697767°
_-27°00'58.74" 152°41'51.96"_

You can get to Neurum Creek Campground by taking [Sellin Road](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=sellin+road+dayboro+queensland&sll=35.338111,-81.860311&sspn=0.013181,0.027874&ie=UTF8&ll=-27.182835,152.815747&spn=0.007187,0.013937&z=17) then turning onto Neurum Creek Road and following it north. Archer Campground can be found by taking Sellin Road then Lovedays Road, however, it is easier to approach from the north side of the forest and head south. Both of these campgrounds require a permit through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or you can [book online](https://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks/iaparks/gds/IAGDS050.jsp?quickParkId=3).

There is another campground called [Neurum Creek Bush Retreat](http://www.ncbr.com.au/) but this is a **different** campground to those two mentioned. It is privately owned and I have personally stayed a weekend there and recommend it, especially if you have children or want a weekend of dirt bike riding (though the operators are understandably strict about noise control) since you can head south into Mount Mee State Forest or head over to [Beerburrum State Forest](http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/park/index.cgi?parkid=7). This campground is even further north of the state forest than the other two (which are situated in the forest boundaries), but is a short ride on gravel to the forest entrance.

[
Here](http://projects.tmorris.net/public/maps/gpx/Mount%20Mee%20State%20Forest.gpx) is a reasonably comprehensive GPX file of Mount Mee State Forest including the two campgrounds and many dirt trails. I'd upload it to OpenStreetMap but I have yet to figure that out.

I use a [Garmin 60Cx](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=309#gpsmap60cx) unit.

I hope this helps ;)

_Update: I have uploaded all tracks to OSM [See here]( http://blog.tmorris.net/mount-mee-state-forest/)_
