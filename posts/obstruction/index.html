<h1>Obstruction</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on April  4, 2007, in <a href="../../tags/Law/index.html">Law</a></div>

<p>On 28 April 2006, I was charged by a police officer for obstruction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/">Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000</a> Section 444 (since amended to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s790.html">Section 790</a>). The police officer alleged at the time that my holding of a sign that reads ‘Police Speed Trap Ahead 50’ – with emphasis on the 50 indicating the speed limit in that area – constituted an offence, obstruction.</p>
<p>I subsequently entered a plea of <em>not guilty</em> (after one adjournment) and made several attempts to obtain a Brief of Evidence from the police prosecution. Their incompetence would normally astound me, but these days I just roll my eyes – in fact, a demonstration of competence itself <em>would</em> invoke surprise (know of one?). Of course, no brief was available, for days, then weeks, then months and in the meantime, I had spent countless hours on putting together a defence.</p>
<p>Finally, the day before the trial, still without a brief (<em>roll eyes now</em>), the police prosecutor rings me and attempts to negotiate – in the usual friendly/manipulative manner as expected. After the usual banter (trying to obtain information from me), I am offered a ‘guilty plea for no conviction’ deal, which I immediately decline and hang up the phone with, ‘see ya tomorrow mate’. I then travelled to the police station to request a brief of evidence, knowing I wouldn’t receive one, but adding to my record of attempts to obtain it, that I would be presenting to the magistrate the following day. A couple of hours later, I receive another phone call to be notified that the charge has been dropped.</p>
<p>This occurred for two reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The police prosecution was too incompetent to get their act together to pursue the charge</p></li>
<li><p>But <strong>most importantly</strong>, the police do not want to set a legal (lawful) precedent for this behaviour</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The police prosecution clearly believed that there was a strong possibility that my not guilty plea would pay off. If it were successful, a subsequent appearance on television (see the first one below) would have propagated the legality of this activity among the public and <strong>the police definitely do not want an informed public</strong> even if it means that I ‘get off’. Instead, it is best to leave the issue ‘blurred’ and continue pursuing ‘offenders’ such as myself, who otherwise do not know any better and enter a guilty plea on the day in court (I understand that many police officers genuinely believe that they are performing a public duty, but let’s leave that side issue).</p>
<p>Although I am not a lawyer, this activity is <strong>not</strong> illegal if it is executed correctly. I encourage any member of the public who is concerned about road-safety in Australia to engage in this lawful behaviour, although I do not accept any liability for any adverse consequences that you may encounter, including, among other things, a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>To engage in this behaviour legally in Queensland (other states may be similar), ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>stand well away from the police speed trap, a few hundred metres at least</p></li>
<li><p>if approached by <strong>anyone</strong>, do not offer comment under any circumstances</p></li>
<li><p>if approached by a police officer, he/she may request your name, address and may also request “evidence of the correctness of the stated name and address” (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s40.html">PPRA2000 Section 40</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Comply if you are asked for name and address, but under no circumstances should you offer further comment on the matter – police are very well trained at extracting this information to ensure your conviction, so it is up to you exercising discipline to keep yourself safe. This request is almost certainly a demand under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s41.html">PPRA 2000 Section 41</a> where the police officer “reasonably suspects the person has committed an offence”, even though you probably haven’t. Do not pursue this ambiguity with the police officer at the scene.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What about flashing vehicle headlights? If you flash your headlights to warn other motorists of an impending speed trap, a police officer will almost certainly issue you with an infringement notice of Rule 218 of the <a href="http://www.ntc.gov.au/ViewPage.aspx?page=A022075053009400200.com">Australia Road Rules</a> (<a href="http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/T/TrantOpRURR99.pdf">Transport Operations Regulation 1999</a> in Queensland). It is important in this case to fulfill your legal obligations (name, address and produce valid driver’s licence) but <strong>offer no other comment</strong> – why? Because you may not have committed an offence, that’s why.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Rule 218 of the ARR (Part 13 Division 1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>218 Using headlights on high-beam (1) The driver of a vehicle must not use the vehicle’s headlights on high-beam, or allow the vehicle’s headlights to be used on high-beam, if the driver is driving: (a) less than 200 metres behind a vehicle travelling in the same direction as the driver; or (b) less than 200 metres from an oncoming vehicle. Offence provision. Note High-beam and oncoming vehicle are defined in the dictionary. (2) However, if the driver is overtaking a vehicle, the driver may briefly switch the headlights from low-beam to high-beam immediately before the driver begins to overtake the vehicle. Note Low-beam and overtake are defined in the dictionary. <em>Diagrams follow</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your infringement notice is for part (1) of Section 218, but a police officer almost certainly will not ask you if you used your signals for part (2). Have you ever asked yourself why ADR (Australian Design Rules) compliant vehicles have a high-beam flasher switch? Of course, because it is entirely legal to flash your high-beam headlights under some circumstances.</p>
<p>If you wish to warn opposing traffic of an impending speed trap, ensure that you flash your headlights under legal circumstances – while overtaking a vehicle, briefly from low-beam to high-beam and immediately before overtaking the vehicle. Do not feel tempted to justify this action on the side of the road with a manipulative police officer! Simply enter your not guilty plea in the court and explain to the magistrate that you were acting legally and responsibly under Rule 218 of the ARR.</p>
