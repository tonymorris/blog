I read an article a while back that made some claims that were **oh so true**. One such claim I will reproduce here because it is one that is in violation of mainstream, but portrays so much truth in so few words. I hope my reproduction is OK with the original author.

Most people I've met have read the  Design Patterns book by the Gang of Four. Any self respecting programmer will tell you that the book is language agnostic and the patterns apply to software engineering in general, regardless of which language you use. This is a noble claim. Unfortunately it is far removed from the truth.




Doesn't it look shiny? No polish required :)
I think it would make a great wall hanging.
