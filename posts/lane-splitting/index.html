<h1>Lane-Splitting in Australia.</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on March 10, 2013, in <a href="../../tags/Motorcycle/index.html">Motorcycle</a>, <a href="../../tags/Law/index.html">Law</a>, <a href="../../tags/Road%20Rules/index.html">Road Rules</a></div>

<p>The subject of lane-splitting on a motorcycle often comes up in discussion. In Australia, the legality of lane-splitting is not absolute. For example, under some circumstances, such as two (or even three) motorcycles sharing a lane, this manouvre may be legal (further specifics apply). Under some other circumstances, lane-splitting is illegal.</p>
<p>Below are verbatim excerpts of Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995; Transport Operations (Road Use Management-Road Rules) Regulation 1999 that are relevant to lane-splitting. The name of this legislation is sometimes abbreviated to <em>TORUM</em>. TORUM applies to the state of Queensland and is derived from the Australian Road Rules (ARR).</p>
<p>Other Australian state and territory road use legislation is also derived from the ARR. Although these sections have been excerpted directly from TORUM, they can also be found in the ARR (under the same sections) and also in the road use legislation for other Australian states and territories.</p>
