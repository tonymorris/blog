# Ride 20150524 Thulimbah

We planned to meet at Rathdown around 0845 on the Sunday morning, knowing that
Rob & Athol had never seen the granite belt. We would take Mt Lindesay Highway 
(or is it Road? haha, there is a back-story to that) to Woodenbong then Legume,
before stopping at the
[Maryland River Bridge](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.4351&mlon=152.3838#map=15/-28.4351/152.3838)
for some beach riding. Soon, we'd turn on to the scenic
[Wylie Creek Road](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.5496&mlon=152.1307#map=15/-28.5496/152.1307)
through [Maryland](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.5627&mlon=151.9986#map=14/-28.5627/151.9986) and on to Thulimbah.

Not another body in sight, only moo-cows, we started the slow climb from 500 to
950 metres above sea level. Arriving at Thulimbah, we did a loop of the Hinze
Enduro Loop, then said our goodbyes.

Entering [Passchendaele State Forest](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-28.5642/151.8168)
from the east, we did a few little loops before deciding that food and fuel were
in order. Having already seen an abundance of wildlife, I was mindful of the
risks at highway speed. That was when a tidings of magpies took off from the
shoulder of the road. Having no air traffic control in this area, these magpies
were completely unaware of my ground speed, which tripled their take-off speed.
One of the individuals, mistakenly, chose the strategy of "outpace the threat."
There was no way to save it, and before I could let up the brakes, I could see 
an explosion of feathers in the mirror. I ventured back to make sure there was 
no more suffering and despite the unfortunate circumstance, felt a mild relief 
that it was all over for that miscalculating magpie.

We fueled and ate at Stanthorpe, while planning the next leg. Another journey
into Passchendaele was all too tempting. Aiming for
[Swiper's Gully](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-28.60556&mlon=151.78448#map=17/-28.60556/15178448), and not knowing if the rabbit fence would prevent access, I
came upon some familiar track landmarks where I reassured myself that this was
the way in.

That was when we decided to stop for a short meeting and Rob's DRZ became a
DRZZZZZZ. Refusing to rest on the kickstand, the DRZ chose to have a little
snooze on its left side. Once again [\[last time\]](http://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/mount-mee-ride-report/index.html), we broke out the orange toolkit for adjustments
and repairs. Soon, we were on the trail to Swiper's Gully at the south end of
Passchendaele. Hooting through the rocky, thin trails, a wild pig scooted out of
our way, and then we came upon an emu carcass. Black cockatoos called out as an
eagle left its high perch in a tree. That was when I knew, dusk was coming.

Turning the bikes east along Donnellys Castle Road, the abundance of bouncing
wallabies, while serene, also served as a caution of what was ahead. Thulimbah,
then Wylie Creek Road, I must have seen 40 wallabies by now. We stopped for a 
road-side meeting where we discussed the dangers ahead. As the sun went down,
I saw a small kangaroo leap in front of Rob's bike. Close call, I thought, but
then a larger roo followed behind, looking to take on the idling DRZ at 70kph.
