I have met thousands of people in my life. Of all those people, each can be described in one of four ways:



	
  1. The person understands monads and would never, without duress, use an imperative programming language

	
  2. The person does not understand monads, would like to and has embarked on doing so in some form

	
  3. The person does not understand monads and would not like to (my doctor for example)

	
  4. The person does not understand monads and in an attempt to do so, has created erroneous simplifications since "not knowing" should be defended at all costs - even if it implies the creation of a false and somewhat convenient reality


I implore any person **not** to fall into the latter category, but I do understand that this imploration is based on **my** value system, which has a strong emphasis on the philosophy of epistemology. If the phrase, "ignorance is bliss" (without the negative connotation), is valuable to you, then so be it. I am also very keen to know of any persons who cannot be described this way, but to date, I have found none.

My school friends were sad when they found out that Santa Claus was not real - I was angry.
