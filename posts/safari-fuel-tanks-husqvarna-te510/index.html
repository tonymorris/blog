<h1>Safari Fuel Tanks -- Husqvarna TE510</h1>
<div class="info">Posted on October 26, 2010, in <a href="../../tags/Motorcycling/index.html">Motorcycling</a></div>

<p><a href="http://www.safaritanks.com.au/home/">Safari Tanks</a> recently released a long range fuel tank for the Husqvarna TE250/310/450/510 4-stroke enduro motorcycle. These bikes come standard with a 7.2 litre fuel tank, which simply does not cut the mustard, particularly for the thirsty 510.</p>
<p>I own a 2009 TE510 and a few weeks ago, I purchased <a href="http://www.safaritanks.com.au/home/14-Husqvarna/55-Husqvarna-TE250-310-450-510/flypage.tpl.html">this tank</a>. I was given the option of four colours: red, white, black or translucent. I chose white and I am happy with this choice. At this time, my bike had only done a few road kilometres and had not yet completed run-in.</p>
<p>Prior to my current TE510, I have owned other Husqvarna four stroke enduro motorcycles, but the TE510 is my first fuel-injected Husky. Below, I will attempt to write a balanced report of my experience with this product. Comments or questions are appreciated.</p>
<p>When it came time to fit the fuel tank, I found that the fuel pump did not install as specified and instead, could only fit in a 180 degree position. This is fine, except the supplied fuel line now did not reach the fuel tap outlet. Safari Tanks were quick to help me with this problem, spending a lot of time on the phone to resolve it (I live in Brisbane, about 1400km from Safari headquarters). Safari supplied me (express postage) with a suitable fuel line for the altered fuel pump fitting after I provided the measurements. This fuel line met my specifications and fit perfectly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://safaritanksusa.com/Husqvarna%20Front.pdf">supplied instructions</a> did not mention that the side radiator guards (not the fins) must be removed, however this was pretty obvious since the tank was not going on otherwise. The fuel tank appears to provide better protection from side impact than the original guards as well. The stock radiator fins did not require any modification at all.</p>
<p>I had trouble fitting the seat since the seat post was a little too far posterior, so I removed the seat post. This allowed the seat to install perfectly.</p>
<p>As for the performance of the tank I cannot speak highly enough. After recently spending a 3-day weekend riding in a <a href="http://osm.org/go/ueGXNhZb-">massive state forest</a>, I didn’t once come even close to hitting reserve on the 510, nor did I ever fill the tank (to keep weight down). The tank is simply enormous and this attracted comments from other riders, even though it blends well with the bike’s styling.</p>
<p>However, aside from the extra weight of carrying more fuel, the ergonomics of the tank are indistinguishable from the original tank and it allows you to adopt a correct riding position even in aggressive riding. I was quite impressed with this obviously clever design given the massive increase in fuel range. I expect this is because the extra fuel capacity is below the typical fuel tank position.</p>
<p>The (supplied) fittings and mountings for the tank are very strong, particularly for the frame mount, and even after some hard riding (to give you an idea, I wrote off the stock tyre in 15 minutes) there was no sign of fatigue.</p>
<p>After going riding with my mates on a 510 race-style enduro with a 7.2 litre tank, it’s usually me who is the first to complain of the need to return to a fuel supply. Not anymore, not even close. I’m very happy with the purchase of the Safari fuel tank and I would recommend it to anyone. After dealing with some minor fitting issues and the obvious attention given to my complaints, I have no doubt that Safari will have sorted out those issues by now. I would recommend this fuel tank to any fellow enthusiast of Husqvarna high-performance motorcycles.</p>
