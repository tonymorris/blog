[Functional Java 3.0](http://functionaljava.org/) is released. As usual, requires any Java 1.5 (or above) runtime and the source can be compiled with any Java 1.5 compiler.

Support for Java 7 BGGA closures is dropped, since the function interfaces are now classes with abstract methods. Other useful additions abound. Have fun!
