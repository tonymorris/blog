# Ride 20150509 Mount Mee

We left Everton Hills, bound for Dayboro, the unmissable town before Mount Mee.
Rob D. had a small dingle on a narrow, downhill bend, leading into a single-lane
bridge. He had a couple of scratches and so did the KLR, but soon we were back
on the road.

At Dayboro, we grabbed a drink before heading up the hill. Soon we were on
the gravel fire trails of Mount Mee State Forest and the tiny 17" supermoto
front wheel (with a Pirelli Corsa Rosso tyre) of the 690 constantly demanded
fast reflexes.

Headed up to Wivenhoe Lookout, the fun way, with the jumps, then on to Rocky
Hole. When we arrived at Woodford, Rob D. had had enough of the loose surface 
and took the tar road. Rob H. and I turned back the way we came and nailed it
through the forest.

Soon, we were back on the tar, heading home. That was when I was hit in the
**helmet visor** by a loose bolt from the leading DR-Z at 100kph. After my
initial shock of this profound collision, I looked up to see the rear guard of
the DR-Z thrashing around loosely. Nothing some cable-ties couldn't fix.

When we arrived at base, we parked up the KTM, DR-Z and KLR. As thoughts of
having a post-ride beer came upon us, instead, we were obliged to repair the
lesser two of the three. The DR-Z needed a less temporary repair for its missing
bolt and the KLR had lost its seat mount bolts and one **rear subframe bolt**.
The KTM watched on.

Now to be completely fair, all was not free for the KTM. It too required
repairs. Given its nature, it had devoured a rear tyre (again, Pirelli Corsa
Rosso).

Once the KLR and DR-Z were put back together, with assistance from the All Hours
Everton Hills Bolt & Tool Shop, they were on the way.

The KTM will be fed its usual diet of rubber through the week.

##### Bolts had been left back at Mount Mee. If you look closely in the background, you can see a KTM parked, waiting, watching, yearning for the next blat.

##### Here is a DR-Z rider, looking for a missing bolt. I don't like his chances.
