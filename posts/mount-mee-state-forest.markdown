I [once wrote about](http://blog.tmorris.net/category/mapping/) the mapping of tracks, campgrounds and points of interest in [Mount Mee State Forest](http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/park/index.cgi?parkid=63). Since I have been trapped in my house for many months due to injury, I have entered all my mapping data into [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) including Mount Mee State Forest.

[Here is a link to the PotLatch map of Mount Mee](http://openstreetmap.org/export?lat=-27.0981&lon=152.6837&zoom=13&layers=B000FTF), however, I much prefer [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/) for entering map data -- a surprisingly usable and relatively bug-free Java application (no really!).

If you have track logs -- particularly in GPX format -- and you're willing to donate them, I'd be happy to enter them in or use them to tighten up some of the tracks already entered.
