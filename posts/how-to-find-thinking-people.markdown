Here is how you find thinking people.



  * You give them a **really** good answer to a problem they are having, spend some effort on it, have it reviewed, etc…

	
  * …then insert the word "fuck."

	
  * If they talk about the word fuck, they are losers.

	
  * If they continue on learning, they are winners.

	
  * Discard losers.

	
  * Try to turn the thinking people into really good winners…

	
  * …then steal their good ideas.

	
  * The losers were never going to give you good ideas anyway.
