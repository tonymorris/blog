When I encounter pseudo-science, it is usually from the computer programming community perverting the mathematical discourse of computing science or the religious fraternity attempting to keep their logical absurdities propped up. I started reading about some of the amusing wonders of Homeopathy a few years ago and I recently came across this gem -- a pure demonstration of utter stupidity and ignorance that will leave you flabbergasted. I don't think this person is consciously lying, do you? Enjoy :)

P.S. It is Stephen **Hawking** (no 's')
