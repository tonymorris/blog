### About the Marcus Porter Memorial

The Marcus Porter Memorial is the annual memorial event to honour the late Marcus Porter who brought such life to any event that he played in. This yearâ€™s edition was organised similarly to recent years with an 8 round tournament run over two Friday nights at Marist College Ashgrove. 
The tournament was a quickplay event with a 10 minute plus 2 second Fischer time control. There is also a special Grob prize awarded to the player with the highest score playing the Grob and the Reverse Grob, in acknowledgement of this being a favourite opening that Marcus liked to spring upon his opponents.

### Tournament Report

*(Thanks to Shane Mather for this)*

Congratulations to David Smerdon who has taken out the 2018 Marcus Porter Memorial.

Well done to Joe Lin who won a beanie for the best placed under 1100 prize.

Congratulations to Tom Maguire who led the way with 7 grob points from 8 attempts and walked with the coveted grob prize. David was second place with 6 grob points from 6 attempts and Jacob Edward third with 5.5 grob points from 8 attempts. Once again a number of players embraced the grob theme and the grob or reverse grob was played 74 times.

The prize for best dressed went to Tyson Walker who was definitely ready for bed in his pj's and shark slippers.

Many thanks to the Porter family who once again donated a beautiful clock trophy for the winner.

Thank you to everyone who played and hope to see you next year.
