Sadly, despite [my expressed hopes](http://blog.tmorris.net/intellij-idea-scala-utterly-unusable/), in appears the state of Intellij IDEA with Scala is not improving but worsening. This is sad. Each time you start up IDEA you still get a lovely internal error and exception stack trace. But worse, ever since the 8890 EAP build, the application hangs with any reasonably sized Scala project. This is even more sad. A colleague has confirmed this on his Mac, however, we are unable to revert to a usable version since you cannot download older EAP releases.

The suspected trend toward becoming more unusable for Intellij IDEA and Scala is regrettably confirmed. I wish it were not so ):

The Windows Vista upgrade to XP effect perhaps?
